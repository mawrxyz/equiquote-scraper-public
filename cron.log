The inflation rate, measuring price changes over time, fell to 6.8% in the year to July, down from 7.9% in June. Lower electricity and gas prices drove the drop, but price rises in other areas have led to expectations that interest rates will be raised further. The cost of eating out has risen, along with alcohol and tobacco prices. Flight prices continued to rise, jumping almost 30% compared to July last year, according to the official figures, released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Inflation is much lower than it was at its peak of 11.1% in October, but it still remains high compared to historical rates and much higher than the Bank of England\'s 2% target. When the rate of inflation falls, it does not mean that prices are coming down, but that they are rising less quickly. Wages have been failing to keep up with rising prices for some time, but there are potential signs of change after figures on Tuesday revealed wages rose 7.8% annually between April and June. Alongside reductions in energy bills, price rises for staple food items like milk, butter, bread, eggs, cereal and fish eased. But overall, food still costs almost 15% more than one year ago. Matthew Corder, deputy director of prices at the ONS, said falling gas and electricity prices drove down inflation last month when a change to the energy price cap, which limits how much suppliers can charge households for what they use, came into force. While easing energy bills and food costs will be welcome for households, there "will be little cause for celebration" at the Bank of England, according to Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. "Inflation is still significantly above that 2% target and even if it is cooling off faster than a sunburnt Brit diving into a hotel pool, prices are not falling, they\'re just not rising as fast as they have been," she said. "Wage increases and price pressures have forced up service costs and that\'s weaving its own nasty spell on core inflation," she added. Core inflation, which strips out the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, remained unchanged in July at 6.9%. The rate is higher than in Germany, France, and the US and it is a figure that is closely watched by the Bank of England, which sets interest rates. With inflation still more than three times the Bank\'s 2% target, many experts expect it will raise interest rates again in September in an attempt to slow price rises. The Bank has steadily increased interest rates to 5.25%, the highest level in 15 years, meaning mortgage costs have jumped, but savings rates have also increased. Higher rates can also lead to high credit card and loan repayments. It hopes that if it makes borrowing more expensive, people will spend less, demand will slow, and prices will not rise as quickly. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said with wage growth and services inflation both stronger than the Bank had expected, its decision makers would look to raise rates from 5.25% to 5.5% in September. In the year to July, services inflation, which includes data on prices for services in venues like bars, hairdressers and restaurants was back up to 7.4%, the joint highest level since 1992. The ONS said price increases for hotels drove services inflation higher. At first glance, this sharp fall in the rate of inflation to below 7% puts the UK on a path to a more "normal" economic situation. However, the underlying measures of inflationary pressures across the economy, are no longer going in the right direction. Services inflation was back up to 7.4% - the joint highest level since 1992. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, remained at 6.9%. The significance of these measures is that they show how much inflation is left in the economy, after the direct impacts of the energy shock have passed through. This set of figures increase the likelihood of further interest rate rises in September and perhaps October too. While the prime minister has said there is "light at the end of the tunnel", Wednesday\'s figures confirm that we can see a tunnel out of this, but it may still be some time before the light is reached.

Feyisara, who runs the business with his wife, said a box of plantain costs between £35 and £40 compared to £16 five years ago, while prices for meat and beans and other imported ingredients have risen. He said he is fortunate to be on a busy street market with steady footfall, but fears if wholesale costs do not ease soon, the shop will have to put up its prices. "Everything\'s gone up but somehow we\'ve been able to absorb it," he said. "If they don\'t fall, we\'ll have to unfortunately increase our prices. So that the business can cope." Prime Minister Rishi Sunak defended his record on tackling the cost of living, saying the plan to ease rising prices was working. He said it was difficult for people to understand the scale of government support with energy bills. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said inflation in Britain remained "higher than many other major economies". "After 13 years of economic chaos and incompetence under the Conservatives, working people are worse off - with higher energy bills and prices in the shops," she said. Heidi Karjalainen, a research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested the government\'s pledge to halve inflation by the end of this year was "always a little odd as there is only so much the Treasury'}

With fewer properties available to rent in many areas, the mismatch between supply and demand has pushed up costs for many people. Prices paid by UK renters rose by 5.3% on average in the year to July, the Office for National Statistics said. The figures come as rising prices continues to squeeze household budgets. The inflation rate, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, fell to 6.8% in the year to July. Although this was down from 7.9% in June, it is still far above the Bank of England\'s target of 2%. High demand from tenants at the same time as landlords reducing the number of available properties is one of the key reasons behind the rent increase. Competition among renters is so intense that there are 20 requests to view each available property, according to recent figures commissioned by the BBC from property portal Rightmove, up from six in pre-pandemic 2019. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows UK average annual rent increases accelerated to 5.3% from 5.2% the previous month. There was a 5.5% increase in rents in London, which was the only region where house prices had fallen. This was the sharpest increase in rent since comparable records began for London in 2006. The same annual rent rise was recorded in the West Midlands as well as Yorkshire and the Humber. There were even bigger rises for tenants in Wales, where the average was up 6.5% in a year, and in Scotland (up 5.7%). In Northern Ireland, where the data is collected slightly differently, there was a 9.2% increase in the year to May, although this was lower than a previous peak. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agency Knight Frank, said: "The squeeze on tenants will not end any time soon." He said that there was more financial pain for tenants as the supply of rental property fell and rents rose. "It is an imbalance compounded by the fact landlords now face higher mortgage rates," he added. Official data on wages and inflation have led analysts to suggest that there could be further rises in the Bank of England\'s benchmark rate, which would mean ongoing pressure on landlords and homeowners through relatively high mortgage rates. Average UK house prices increased by 1.7% annually, down from a revised 1.8% rise in May, the ONS said, as the market cools as a result of the mortgage rate hikes.

Sara's body was found at her home in Woking, Surrey, on 10 August. The BBC has spoken to a travel agent in the town who said he was contacted by someone known to Sara, wanting tickets for three adults and five children. Police want to speak to three people known to Sara - who they have not named - and who left the UK on 9 August. Surrey Police launched a murder investigation after Sara's body was found alone in the family home 02:50 BST. Speaking to the BBC, the travel agent in Woking identified the person making the booking on the evening of 8 August to travel the following day, whom he said had used his services before. The BBC has spoken to police in Pakistan who have said that no formal approach has been made by the British authorities over the case. Pakistan and the UK do not have a formal extradition treaty. In an interview with the Sun newspaper Sara's mother spoke about her grief and disbelief that her daughter was dead. Olga Sharif was divorced from Sara's father, who had custody of the child. A post-mortem examination was due to be carried out yesterday (Tuesday) on the 10-year-old but a cause of death has not been formally confirmed."}

The prime minister said halving inflation was a top priority and his plan to ease rising prices was working. It comes as the latest figures showed inflation slowed last month due to lower energy costs. But food, restaurants and hotel costs are still rising. The inflation rate, which measures price changes over time, fell to 6.8% in the year to July, down from 7.9% in June. This means prices are rising less quickly. Inflation is much lower than it was at its peak of 11.1% in October, but it still remains high compared to historical rates and much higher than the Bank of England\'s 2% target. Speaking at a business event in Enderby, Leicestershire, Mr Sunak said that unlike furlough, where the government subsidised wages of employees hit by the Covid pandemic, "no one quite understands the scale of what we\'ve done" with energy bill support. "A typical family will have had about half their energy bills paid for by the government over past several months - that\'s worth £1,500 to a typical family," he said. "Now you wouldn\'t have quite seen that because you would have still just got your energy bill, it would have been very high and you\'d have been, \'Oh my gosh, what\'s going on\', but what you wouldn\'t have realised, maybe, is that before that even happened, £1,500 had been lopped off, and the government had covered it." Under the Energy Price Guarantee, the government limited energy bills for a typical household to £2,500 a year, alongside a £400 winter discount. However, the guarantee ended in July. The Liberal Democrats described Mr Sunak\'s comments as "woefully out of touch". The party\'s Cabinet Office spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: "Does he expect the public to give the Conservative Party a pat on the back for crashing the economy and adding hundreds of pounds a month to people\'s mortgages? "He just does not get it." Mr Sunak said his plan to halve inflation, by being "responsible" with spending and borrowing, was working. However, speaking to journalists at the same event, he said he was "not complacent" and knew "things are tough right now". The prime minister added that the government was also helping people by cutting fuel duty, capping bus fares outside London, and giving support payments to pensioners and people on Universal Credit. Labour\'s deputy leader Angela Rayner said the fall in inflation was a "relief" but prices were still going up, just at a lower rate. She blamed the Conservatives for "a decade of low growth, low pay and high taxes".'}

Jubilant Lionesses celebrate reaching first World Cup final with 3-1 win over Australia by dancing to Sweet Caroline in their dressing room - before Sarina Wiegman tells them to save their energy for the next game', 'byline': 'TOM PYMAN', 'time': '2023-08-16T15:38:08+0100', 'text': "The Lionesses celebrated reaching their maiden World Cup final, and England's first in nearly 60 years, by dancing to Sweet Caroline today - but there were only soft drinks in sight with one more step to go on the road to glory. The team's official Twitter account posted three images from behind the scenes in Sydney, following an historic 3-1 win over old rivals, Australia. It was captioned 'Good times never seemed so good!' - lyrics from the Neil Diamond classic which has become something of a celebratory anthem for England in recent tournaments. Goalscorers Lauren Hemp and Ella Toone led the jubilant scenes Down Under - but focus was clearly already turning to Sunday's final with Spain, as the players were pictured with cans of Fanta and Coke, rather than champagne. Boss Sarina Wiegman was clearly keen to keep a lid on celebrations, even telling defender Lucy Bronze to 'stop jumping' and to immediately begin preparations for Sunday's showpiece final. Reflecting on her coach's speech after the game, Bronze said: 'She just spoke a bit about the game today, she knew the crowd was going to be a big thing and we could control the game and win the game the way we wanted to, we did all those things and how proud she was of us. 'We started jumping up and celebrating she grabbed me and said 'stop jumping, you need to get ready for the next game, let the kids do it, you stand still'.' Australian fans were left crying into their beers as goals for England from Toone, Hemp and Alessia Russo sealed victory and put the Lionesses 90 minutes away from lifting two major trophies in just under 13 months. Second half strikes for the European champions from Russo and Hemp silenced the home crowd of 75,000 hostile fans amid a febrile atmosphere in Sydney, with Hemp's strike coming just minutes after Sam Kerr had equalised. England will now take on Spain for the trophy this Sunday at 11am UK time, after they beat Sweden 2-1 yesterday to book their trip to the final. The match comes just over a year after England won Euro 2022 by beating Germany and is England's first World Cup final since the men's famous triumph back in 1966. The Lionesses have clearly captured the hearts and minds of a nation once again, as all three Boxpark fan zones in London sold out eight minutes after the final whistle. A Boxpark spokesperson said that 2,500 tickets across their sites in Shoreditch, Wembley and Croydon sold out in under 10 minutes. A fan zone at Boxpark Croydon turned into an impromptu dance floor on Wednesday as the Lionesses confirmed their place in the final, knocking out the host nation. The only person who seemed to be sitting down when the final whistle was heard at the south London venue was a lone Australian at the front of the zone. Lionesses fans put children on their shoulders, danced on tables and sang football hits following the historic victory. Alison Symonds-Tayler, 65, watched England make the final at Boxpark Croydon. Draped in a Union flag and wearing a matching bow, the south Londoner said: 'We deserved to win. I think we dominated throughout the match and it was very exciting. 'I just think the girls did really well. Both teams did really well. There was a fantastic atmosphere. Boxpark did a great job. 'I feel sorry for the Matildas because I have Australian family but I think the best team won today. I think it's great to have women's sport get the credit it deserves.' A young England fan who also watched the game at Boxpark Croydon said it would be 'amazing for all upcoming footballers' if the Lionesses win the World Cup. Emily Bowen, 15, who had painted a St George's flag on her face using red glitter, told PA: 'I was actually ecstatic when the full-time whistle went. The click of reality, we're through to a World Cup final. 'After Australia equalised it was a bit nervy they were going to come back but (the Lionesses) stayed strong... I'm buzzing. 'We went out to France for the 2019 World Cup and then all of the Euros games last year we were at. I try to follow them everywhere and anywhere.' When asked how she will react if England win the World Cup, the Kent resident added: 'I honestly don't know. Just seeing the growth from when they won the Euros, to see that carry on, if they win the World Cup it would be amazing for all upcoming footballers, inspiring all the younger girls.' Dani Beazley, 51, vowed to return to Boxpark Croydon to watch England hopefully win the World Cup this weekend. Ms Beazley, from Battersea in south-west London, said: 'I will definitely be back on Sunday. I'm with my daughter and my sister. The reaction in the whole place is unbelievable. The place erupted. It was just brilliant. 'It is a brilliant atmosphere. (The music) goes on for an hour later and everyone is still enjoying themselves and having a lovely time. We are going to stick around for a while. 'It's a great atmosphere and Sunday will just be amazing. It will be double this. I reckon England 2-0. Fingers crossed.' In today's semi-final, both sides had early chances, with a key flashpoint just seconds in as Australia got a free kick after England's Keira Walsh fouled Kerr. Then, Alex Greenwood was booked on ten minutes for fouling the Aussie forward. England opened the scoring in the 36th minute when the ball skipped past Hemp inside the area and fell at the feet of Toone, who gave Australia goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold no chance with a strike into the top right corner. The Lionesses held a 1-0 lead at half-time, while millions of England fans watched on TV back home - with some taking a few hours off work to go to a pub or having it on the"}

William and Kate were seen holidaying on the Caribbean island of Mustique with the Middleton family, or off on a couple\'s ski trip in the Alps. While for many their jet-setting lifestyle looked dreamlike, it did not impress the late Queen who apparently expressed concern about the number of holidays her future granddaughter-in-law was taking every year. Perhaps aware that William and Kate would soon be engaged, the Queen stressed that the future Princess should get a job rather hoping around from country to country. The stern words of advice were said to have \'stung\' Kate, Royal expert Katie Nicholl has suggested. She wrote in her 2010 book William and Harry: \'If she was not with William at Balmoral then the couple were skiing or holidaying on Mustique. \'Kate was there so often the press dubbed her "Queen of Mustique", a title that had previously belonged to Princess Margaret\'. Princess Margaret\'s beautiful ten acre manor of Les Jolies Eaux, or Beautiful Waters, became her hideaway from the world\'s scrutiny after her marriage to the late Lord Snowdon imploded. She later said it was the only place where she could \'truly relax\'. When Kate was heading to the island in the 2000s, Britain was heading into a recession, and \'such frivolous displays of wealth were unpalatable to the Queen\', according to Nicholls. She added: \'While the rest of the world speculated that an engagement was on the horizon for William and Kate, the Queen believed an announcement should be postponed until Kate was settled in a career.\' One source quoted in the book added: \'It is Her Majesty\'s opinion that if Kate is one day going to be William\'s consort, then she needs a proper job. \'Swanning from one five-star holiday resort to another is not the prerequisite for a young woman possibly destined to be Queen.\' It is clear that the royal couple, since marrying and having their three children, have taken the Queen\'s advice to heart. While they have been seen holidaying on the Caribbean island since, they have also taken more staycations, including trips to their Norfolk, the Isle of Scilly and Balmoral. The family will also avoid overseas trips with their young children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, seven, and Prince Louis, according to OK! Magazine. Instead, they will holiday at their Norfolk royal residence, Amner Hall, instead of jetting off each summer. The royal expert told the magazine: \'Summer holidays at Anmer are the perfect way for Kate and William to decompress. \'If there are royal engagements for them, they\'ll be few and far between. \'While in the past we\'ve seen the couple enjoy more lavish holidays skiing or visiting sunnier climates, they\'ve been adopting a more traditional royal approach and spending their time at royal residences in the UK instead. \'This could obviously be the result of Covid travel restrictions, but I also believe that Kate and William are transforming into the future King and Queen and therefore are adopting more traditional practices.\''}

The Retail Sector Council, which is made up of members including the bosses of Boots, Sainsbury's and Primark, told ministers that competition law needed to be reformed to support the industry. Former Co-op chief Richard Pennycook, who is co-chairman of the council, said towns across the country risked becoming 'wastelands' because of the demise of high streets. He said: 'If we don't incentivise regeneration, then these places are getting hollowed out. 'What are we collectively going to do about that? The last five years in Chester, Northampton, pretty much any large town in the UK, this has been going on.' A Marks & Spencer executive also warned that crime rates on Oxford Street are surging as London's famous shopping district falls into disrepair. Sacha Berendji, the chain's operations director, said the area had once been 'the jewel in London's shopping crown' but was now little more than 'empty shops, littered streets and fewer visitors'. He said shocking scenes of social media-fuelled carnage this week as thugs attempted to loot stores were 'another reminder of how bad things are'. Mr Berendji told the Daily Telegraph: 'The street was practically locked down by police to prevent major unrest planned on social media. Londoners know that something must be done to save Oxford Street.' The chaos in central London echoes robberies and flashmob looting across the US in recent years, which has been organised through TikTok – while major cities such as San Francisco and New York are becoming crime-ravaged and drug-infested. It comes amid a battle to save Oxford Street, which is one of the biggest victims of the slow death of the high street across Britain. It has been overrun in recent years by tacky sweet shops that have replaced household names. Mr Berendji's comments come three weeks after M&S was refused permission to knock down and redevelop its Oxford Street store after opposition from Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove. Crowds gathered in Oxford Street last week after posts circulated on TikTok and Snapchat urging users to rob JD Sports. Nine people were arrested and Scotland Yard issued 34 dispersal orders, banning offenders from the area for 48 hours. Fears of violence then spread to Southend after troublemakers urged copycats to 'get lit' on the beach. Among those given a dispersal order by Essex Police officers yesterday was notorious TikTok prankster Mizzy, real name Bacari-Bronze O'Garro. The 18-year-old, who has been arrested on multiple occasions over pranks including invading people's homes, posted a video on social media of him being spoken to by a police officer in the sunshine outside the seafront's theme park Adventure Island. Oxford Street was once the flagship location for Britain's high-end stores but the shopping destination is becoming increasingly abandoned by the big-name brands that earned it such esteem. Photos taken by MailOnline revealed how Oxford Street has suffered and is now home to empty shells of ornate stonework stores that used to house some of the UK's most famous brands. The coronavirus pandemic has changed the look of the British high street for ever as iconic brands were plunged into administration and forced to close their doors. As big names such as TopShop, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Debenhams, Oasis and Warehouse disappeared, city centres across the country were left with empty windows and people instead searching for their favourite labels online. Despite this, shoppers continue to creep back, with footfall up 12 per cent year-on-year last week and seven per cent since the beginning of the year, according to New West End Company, which represents 600 retailers and hoteliers in the area. Britain's high streets were already in a state of decline as shoppers increasingly turned to online fast fashion. Yet the pandemic has been blamed for the eventual closures of popular shops. Big name brands have fled Oxford Street, leaving behind ghost stores in the once-iconic shopping destination. One of the most famous to go has been TopShop – which, just a decade ago, was the undisputed queen of the British high street. With its trendy clothes, sell-out designer collaborations and 100,000 sq ft Oxford Street flagship store, the brand attracted everyone from tourists and teenagers to It Girls and fashion editors. It is believed that aggressive competition from the likes of PrettyLittleThing, Boohoo and Missguided, which have lured Gen Z shoppers with their ultra fast fashion and even faster delivery times – perfect for a generation focused on showcasing style on social media – contributed to its demise. The burden of TopShop's 510 branches, including some 300 in the UK, was felt more keenly than ever as the Covid-19 pandemic led to a dramatic drop in footfall and a record number of shops closing during the first half of 2020. And its doors closed for ever after rescue plans to save the Arcadia group, owned by billionaire Sir Philip Green, failed and it entered administration in November 2021, making up to 2500 staff members redundant. Asos bought TopShop, alongside Topman and Miss Selfridge in April 2021 as part of a £330million deal to save the brands. The deal did not include the physical shops but you can still buy TopShop, Topman and Miss Selfridge clothes online on ASOS' website. Lisa Byfield-Green, Retail Week's data and insights director, said she expected more high street brands to go under due to the tough economic conditions. 'Investors are nervous right now in the difficult economic environment. Companies are also receiving no relief from rising business rates, which puts many high street businesses in danger,' she said. 'We expect to see the continuation of these difficulties into 2023. As the strain continues to mount, smaller and struggling retailers will be snapped up by larger brands (e.g. Next acquiring Made) or fall into administration. The market will diverge between success stories and those that cannot sustain the weight of"}

Hannah Ingram-Moore reportedly attended and judged awards ceremonies in 2021 and 2022 as interim chief executive of the Captain Tom Foundation, but had payments for the appearances made to her company, the Maytrix Group. The BBC claim thousands of pounds went into Maytrix after she attended the Virgin Media O2 Captain Tom Foundation Connector Awards – despite promotional videos suggesting she was representing the charity. In a firm email responding to the broadcaster's report, Ms Ingram-Moore initially said: 'You are awful. It's a total lie'. Six minutes later, however, she scrambled together a response telling the BBC: 'Apologies. That reply was for a scammer who has been creating havoc'. The Virgin Media event was named after the charity and had the charity logo on its award plaques. She is thought to have been on a salary of £85,000 as the charity's interim chief executive at the time. Ms Ingram-Moore, who owns Maytrix with her husband Colin, has not responded to the claims. Over the last year the Charity Commission has been investigating the Captain Tom Foundation for potential conflicts of interest. Her father, Sir Captain Tom Moore, made headlines during the pandemic for raising £38million for the NHS on sponsored laps of his garden. Ms Ingram-Moore did not seek approval from the Foundation's board before making her own commercial agreement with Virgin Media O2, BBC Newsnight reported last night. As a result an internal investigation was begun in November last year. She has not replied to questions from BBC Newsnight. The Charity Commission said its inquiry 'includes examining whether the trustees have adequately managed conflicts of interest, including with private companies connected to the Ingram-Moore family'. A Virgin Media spokesperson said: 'We worked directly with the late Sir Captain Tom to recognise community groups and charities that went above and beyond during the Covid-19 pandemic. 'When payment was made, we were not aware of any concerns about Ms Ingram-Moores family companies or the Captain Tom Foundation that have since come to light after our campaign and relationship with Captain Tom finished.' Virgin Media said they started working with Captain Tom directly during the lockdown, prior to the concerns raised about governance at either the Foundation or Ingram-Moores' companies. The Charity Commission has now been investigating possible conflicts of interest between Ingram-Moores' private companies and the charity for over a year. Captain Tom Moore raised money for the NHS Charities Together prior to the creation of the Captain Tom Foundation. He raised £38mn for the NHS Charities Together via a Just Giving page, sponsored for walking circuits of his garden during the lockdowns in 2020. The money raised in this way was donated directly to NHS Charities Together via the Just Giving page, and the Charity Commission has confirmed this money is not part of its investigation. The Captain Tom Foundation was set up in June 2020 with its declared aim to be recognising and raising money for organisations supporting the elderly in the UK. A spokesperson for NHS Charities Together said: 'The Captain Tom Foundation is a separate organisation that was established after Captain Tom raised funds for our Covid-19 Urgent Appeal, and the Charity Commission has made clear that the £38 million he raised for NHS Charities Together is not part of their investigation. 'In total our appeal raised over £160 million thanks to generous donations from thousands of supporters. 'This money has been distributed across the network of NHS charities to reach every NHS Trust and Health Board in the UK – funding thousands of projects providing vital mental health support for NHS staff, training for emergency volunteers, equipment and support for patients, and community partnership programmes to prevent ill health and reduce pressure on NHS services. 'The support we continue to provide has never been more important, and we are thankful to everyone who helps make it possible. 'A Covid appeal Progress Report demonstrates the difference donations are making and is available on our website.' A formal inquiry was later opened amid claims of potential mismanagement and misconduct between the separate Foundation and the Ingram-Moore's own companies. The Charity Commission has looked into decisions that may have 'generated significant profit' for Ingram-Moore and her partner by trademarking the Captain Tom brand without objection from the charity. Last month, the Captain Tom Foundation was also forced to clarify it was 'not under investigation' amid questions around an allegedly illegal extension to Ingram-Moore's £1.2mn Bedfordshire home. Foundation bosses halted the acceptance of donations as planning chiefs ordered that the annexe be razed. Ingram-Moore is no longer running the charity, but her husband remains a trustee. She and her husband are still directors of the Maytrix Group and Club Nook, which found itself at the centre of an inquiry around trademarked products. The Charity Commission last year explored concerns Club Nook 'may have generated significant profit' by trademarking the 'Captain Tom' brand without any objection from the charity. It has also investigated allegations of mismanagement and misconduct, and potential conflicts of interest between the foundation and companies set up by the late Second World War veteran's family. MailOnline has contacted Ms Ingram-Moore for a comment."}

Inspector Nicholas Mantle, of Dorset Police, was part of a WhatsApp group which was found to have shared sexual, pornographic, racist, homophobic, bullying and misogynistic messages. A misconduct hearing held in June found that he posted two offensive images in the WhatsApp chat and did not leave the group. While Mantle was not found to be the main instigator of the 'alpha male' offensive behaviour he failed to challenge a culture of bullying by the group of four other police officers that he supervised. He was found guilty of gross misconduct by the hearing panel who decided on Tuesday that he should be dismissed without notice. Mantle will now be placed on the barred list, meaning he cannot be employed in policing again. The four other officers involved in the WhatsApp group have already been dealt with. PC Mark Jordan-Gill and former officer Paul Perdrisat, who resigned before the misconduct hearing, were also found guilty of gross misconduct and placed on the barred list. PC Michael Lowther, who challenged the behaviour and left the WhatsApp group, and PC Matthew Young, who didn't challenge the group but had very limited participation, were found guilty of misconduct and handed a written warning and a final written warning respectively. The men were all serving as part of the Force Support Group between 2018 and 2021, when 'alpha male' Perdrisat bullied officers he saw as the weak link and created a 'toxic atmosphere'. He was also a major contributor to the WhatsApp group 'The Real FSG' where hundreds of offensive messages and images were shared. Following the conclusion of the final hearing in respect of Mantle, Temporary Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Farrell, Dorset Police's lead for professional standards, said the inspector encouraged the actions of his colleagues. She said: 'Inspector Nicholas Mantle was in a trusted supervisory role when he breached the Standards of Professional Behaviour by not only failing to challenge the derogatory and biased actions of colleagues within the team but also encouraged it by posting two offensive images to the group. 'His lack of action in failing to challenge this behaviour and failing to act when PC Lowther called it out is completely unacceptable. 'This is not the type of leader we wish to have in our force and as this case has shown we will robustly investigate offences and, if appropriate, remove individuals from the organisation. 'The public quite rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour from serving police officers and staff as this is a core component of maintaining the trust of our communities. 'I know the actions of these officers will have let our communities down. 'It is important to remind the public that this behaviour is not indicative of the overwhelming majority of our staff and teams out delivering quality policing every day to protect people and make Dorset a safe county for everyone. 'We are committed to driving up standards of behaviour within Dorset and ongoing work includes adopting learning across the organisation from this case to stamp out such behaviour, delivering inclusion training to officers and staff, and ensuring our vetting and enhanced vetting obligations are being met and fit for purpose.'"}

ENGLAND SCORE THEIR 3rd GOAL AGAINT AUSTRALIA!! ⚽️⚽️⚽️ #wwc2023 #lionesses pic.twitter.com/2NrYcKlsSX Reaction of England Fans at BOXPARK Wembley 3/ pic.twitter.com/f7ZMyXKUvz Ella Toone\'s stunning strike was followed up by cool finishes from Lauren Hemp and Alessia Russo for England to see off co-hosts Australia with a hard-fought 3-1 win. And the countdown has now begun before Sunday\'s final against Spain, who like England, are in the Women\'s World Cup final for the first time in their history. While it was joy for England, Australia were left heartbroken. Many supporters of the co-hosts at the match in Sydney were in tears as the Matildas crashed out. Back at home, England fans were toasting success in pubs up and down the country. There was chaos at BOXPARK Wembley as supporters, many in face paint, erupted over early morning pints. Many were draped in St George\'s flags as they went wild as the Lionesses did them proud - and even better, got one over the Aussies. England hero Gary Lineker took to Twitter to praise the Lionesses, tweeting: "Well played @Lionesses. Absolutely superb performance. A World Cup final. BETTING SPECIAL - BEST NO DEPOSIT CASINO OFFERS "A World Cup final at football. It’s been a while. What a wonderful achievement. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻." SunSport columnist Piers Morgan joked it was revenge for the summer\'s controversial Ashes series, writing: "England’s fabulous @Lionesses crush Australia’s wilting Matildas 3-1 in their own back yard to reach the Women’s World Cup Final… "Sweet revenge for the Jonny Bairstow Ashes runout debacle. "Congrats ladies- you’ve made your country proud! 👏👏👏." England defender Lucy Bronze declared it was a dream come true for her and her team-mates. Speaking to the BBC, she said: "The one thing I\'ve always wanted to do is get to a World Cup final. "After two times of such disappointment, I can\'t believe it. "We played how we wanted to, we were determined, resilient. We knew the crowd would be crazy and we talked about silencing them and at the end we did that. "We all dreamed of being in the final, all our family and friends have boked to stay here until then because they all believed in us. "It\'s been amazing to play against Australia, in Australia, what a fantastic tournament they had but we\'re in the final." Sarina Wiegman hailed her England team in an emotional interview with the BBC, saying: “The way we played… of course it was a hard game but we found a way to win. You’ve been talking about ruthlessness all the time, in this team there is ruthlessness. Whether it’s in attack or defence, we really want to keep the ball out of the net. “We stuck to the plan. I think [Australia have] done an incredible job. They really grew into the tournament. They’ve had some setbacks too… they had to win the last game in the group stage. As a team they are really tough to play against. Yeah, what a performance. "[On reaching a second World Cup final]. I don’t know. I just said… am I in a little fairytale or something?" Injury-stricken Lioness Beth Mead praised her team-mates as she said: "WORLD CUP FINAL BABBYY, GET IN @Lionesses 🥳🥳🥳." Despite huge injuries to Mead, Leah Williamson and Fran Kirby impacting the squad before the tournament, the brave Lionesses have overcome each obstacle they have faced so far. England kicked off their tournament with a stuttering 1-0 win over Haiti, before felling Denmark with the same score six days later. A Lauren James-inspired England then roared into life as they thrashed China 6-1 in their final group stage match. However, it was James who soon became the pantomime villain after her needless red card against Nigeria in the Last 16. Penalties followed after a goalless affair. But the Lionesses held their nerve, with Chloe Kelly\'s rocket of a penalty seeing us through to the quarter-finals, where our the side - captained by Millie Bright - faced off with Colombia. Once again the opponent proved to be tough, with the South Americans taking the lead shortly before half-time. But a last-gasp first-half equaliser from Hemp sent England into the interval level before Russo netted the decisive winner as England marched into the semi-final. The Matildas, bolstered by a returning Sam Kerr, would prove to be the biggest hurdle of all. Toone\'s first half strike was cancelled out by a Kerr stunner in the 63rd minute. However, Hemp fired the Lionesses back in front eight minutes later, shoving off her marker before slotting her shot into the bottom corner. The Women\'s Super Leagues first million pound star Russo then sealed the deal with her tidy finish into the bottom corner in the 86th minute. With the win England\'s Lionesses have made history by reaching their first World Cup final. And we\'re all desperate for them to repeat their trick of winning the Euros last year.'}

The star driver made a healthy £7million profit after selling the rare supercar for £8.5m last year. The 36-year-old purchased the vehicle for £1.6m with the motor specifically made for the seven-time Formula One world champion. But yesterday it was pictured severely damaged after a crash in the Penmaenbach Tunnel on the A55 expressway in Conwy, North Wales. Ethan Gale, a supercar photographer posted pictures of the damage on Instagram and wrote: "Very sad day in the motoring world this evening. "A car I never thought I would see. "Ever since seeing this on YouTube driving around Monaco back in the day, it’s always been a dream car to tick off the list. "Late this afternoon this Pagani Zonda 760 LH previously owned by Lewis Hamilton had crashed in the Penmaenbach tunnel, Conwy, North wales. "Hopefully the car gets a full restoration and is back on the road in the future." The one-off car, which boasts a purple exterior, was personally ordered from Horacio Pagani by Hamilton seven years ago. The Zonda 760 LH is capable of reaching 217mph, and can go from 0-60mph in less than three seconds. Hamilton once famously crashed the whip into three parked cars in 2015 in Monte Carlo ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix. He revealed that the accident was a result of heavy partying and a lack of sleep that caused him to lose control. The Arsenal fan remarked: "It was a result of heavy partying and not much rest for a week and a half. "I am a bit run down. I have been non-stop and trying to fit training in at the same time and not getting a lot of sleep.”'}

Katie Loxton, 27, embarked on a relationship with 32-year-old Adam Higgs while working at HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire. The couple spoke on the phone for more than 380 hours in 3,451 different calls during their six-month tryst. Higgs also used the contraband phone to message Loxton on social media. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the pair would often "perform sexual acts to each other" during the calls. Loxton has now been jailed for 12 months for misconduct in a public office. Higgs was handed an eight-month sentence for possessing inside a prison a device capable of transmitting or receiving images, sounds or information by electronic communications. The pair also admitted transmitting or causing the transmission of an image/sound by electronic means from within a prison. The court was told Loxton was arrested on January 27 last year.

While mating season usually begins in early September, when the little beasties search for somewhere to live over the winter, our cooler summer means many are beginning their hunt early. Male spiders often come into houses in search of females that have remained lurking indoors in places such as bathrooms and kitchen cabinets. Here, we look at what these giant spiders are, and pest controller Stuart Halliday gives his tips on how to get rid of them for good. Many different spider species will invade our homes this autumn, but the giant house spider is the one you will see most often. They live in sheds, attics, homes and out-buildings and can survive for several months without any food or water. They can have leg spans of up to 12cm and are seen all year round but mate in the autumn time. Entomologist Brian Eversham told ITV news there is a simple explanation for why they appear so big - that they grow during the spring and pop up this time of year as adults. "This happens every year - during the spring time they are often quite small, and come late summer and adult, the spiders are adults," he said. "They are fast moving, so they are the ones that people tend to notice. The females, quite sensibly, sit quietly in a corner of a room in their web, catching insects. People almost never notice that they\'ve got female house spiders, tucked away in a shaded corner. "The males go walking around, looking for the females, and that\'s when people tend to notice them. People think that there are suddenly a lot more, but it\'s just that they have started behaving differently." Although, this spider is called the \'giant\' spider, it\'s not the biggest in the UK. The cardinal spider is the largest spider across the British isles. Otherwise known as Tegenaria parietina, some of these spiders have been recorded to have a leg span of 12cm. It normally lives for two or three years, but lifetimes of up to six years have been observed. While the female only leaves its nest to feed, males can often be seen wandering around houses during the late summer and early autumn looking for a mate. This so-called "spider season" normally begins in the first two weeks of September and ends by the first week of October. Keeping your house clean is the most effective way to deter spiders. Dust and vacuum any spider webs or egg sacs (which will be ball shaped, and often hidden in the web) waiting to hatch. Spiders will be less eager to return when their offspring and habitats have been removed. If you do this as soon as you spot them, it will make cleaning a whole lot easier. Top of the list and perhaps the easiest (and most fragrant) is to use peppermint oil to deter our eight-legged friends. After cleaning your home, you can mix up a two-part solution by adding around 20 drops of peppermint oil to a bottle of water. Simply pour this into a spray bottle and spritz all around your house. Bottles of peppermint oil cost as little as £2 online for 10ml. And the good news is that with 20 drops equating to around 1ml, you can whip up a handy homemade spray for just 20p. Citrus and eucalyptus are also good alternatives. You can peel lemons and oranges and leave the peel in places where spiders might like to hide to put them off, but replace it regularly as the aroma won’t last forever. Another simple way to stop the crawlies getting in is to seal up any cracks around your doors and windows, according to pest control expert Stuart Halliday. "Sometimes if you have your windows changed, or if you live in an older property, there can be gaps both on the inside and outside meaning spiders and other insects can get in," he said. "You should make sure these are sealed up and then to help keep the spiders out put lemongrass cleaners or oil around windows and doors as they don\'t like the smell. "Also growing basil, thyme and rosemary on windowsills will keep the pests out and deter wasps, woodlice and other small crawlies."'}

"I don\'t remember being frightened of being interviewed by Michael, because it was just like talking to a really good friend," she said. "His enjoyment and love of doing it, it was a complete joy to watch. He never shunned asking a direct question." In his tribute, Sir Elton added: "I loved his company and his incredible knowledge of cricket and Barnsley Football Club. A real icon who brought out the very best in his guests." Beckham appeared on Parkinson with wife Victoria in 2001, when she famously revealed his Goldenballs nickname. The former footballer wrote: "I was so lucky to not just be interviewed by Michael but to be able to spend precious time talking about football and family, our 2 passions. Plus the GoldenBalls moment…" Actor Sir Michael Caine said: "Michael Parkinson was irreplaceable, he was charming, always wanted to have a good laugh. He brought the best of everyone he met. Always looked forward to be interviewed by him." A statement from the chat show host\'s family on Thursday said: "After a brief illness Sir Michael Parkinson passed away peacefully at home last night in the company of his family. "The family request that they are given privacy and time to grieve." As told to BBC Radio 4\'s The World At One As a viewer, you knew if Michael was asking the questions, there were going to be good questions, and they would elicit good answers. As a network controller, I thought he was the best freelance interviewer in the business. He was always knowledgeable, he was absolutely classless. You knew he was not a southerner, you knew he was a northerner, and that was a very refreshing voice in those days. You knew that he would do his homework, and that he would ask questions that didn\'t occur to you, as well as those that did. I thought he was the best interviewer in the business at that time. He was extremely generous. He wanted you to shine, and not particularly himself. He would always laugh at your jokes, and give you an opportunity to make them sound funnier than in fact they were. When you were told that he was going to be the interviewer, it was like meeting a friend. Though in fact we didn\'t meet very often, but you knew that he was on your side as much as on his own. He was Saturday night television, and there\'s nobody like him doing the sort of things that he did when his career was at its height. Television doesn\'t give that kind of space to interviews these days, to its loss, and of course Michael did it better than anybody. I remember he was interviewing me and Billy Connolly together, and of course Billy Connolly made both of us laugh a lot but he laughed even at my jokes, and my stories, and, as it were, looked after me to make sure I wasn\'t swamped by Billy Connolly, who is after all a very big character. With Michael, it was always friendly, always thorough, always intelligent, always a pleasure to do it, and I think that came over no matter who his interviewee was. He always knew what the interesting bits were, and he steered you through that sort of thing. He was always generous in the way he framed his questions. He wanted you, his interviewee, to shine. I didn\'t ever see him uncomfortable, he was unflappable. It didn\'t matter what you did, whether it was a puppet that tried to consume him, or if he was interviewing a great intellect, he was always in charge, but not dominantly so. Comedian and travel presenter Sir Michael Palin described the broadcaster as "incisive and very sharp". Sir Michael told The World At One: "He wanted to get people on his show who entertained him and therefore who he thought would entertain the audience. He was not picky. He was not trying to diss anybody. He was an enthusiast and he was very positive. "It didn\'t always work," he noted. "In some cases, [interviewees] suspected what they saw as the difficult questions he might ask in among all the fun and the enjoyment. "Because he was a very good journalist, and a very proud journalist, and it was very important for him not to give people an easy ride. But he did basically choose people he liked, because he liked to be entertained himself." On social media, TV presenter Davina McCall described Sir Michael as "unique and always so well researched". "[He was] loved by all the biggest stars in the world and they were all desperate to be interviewed by him," she continued. "Funny, self deprecating, sharp, charming, strong, honest and a fantastic listener. His legacy is enormous." Former prime minister Theresa May said Sir Michael was "a remarkable man and an outstanding broadcaster". "We knew each other well through his charitable work in my constituency and our mutual passion for cricket. My thoughts and prayers are with his family," she added. Match of the Day host Gary Lineker described Sir Michael a "a truly brilliant broadcaster and wonderful interviewer", while presenter Dermot O\'Leary said he was "one of the greats". "But above all else he listened… in a world full of noise," O\'Leary added. "RIP Michael, thanks for the education." Boxer Frank Bruno praised Sir Michael\'s ability "to frame and gift wrap the guest to deliver to the TV viewer".

That is almost back to pre-pandemic levels. It follows a spike in top grades in 2020 and 2021, when exams were cancelled because of Covid. The drop is steeper in England, where grades were due to be brought back in line with 2019 in this year\'s results. In Wales and Northern Ireland, grades were always meant to be a bit higher this year. Overall, there are 73,008 fewer top grades compared with 2022, but 31,834 more than in 2019. The pass rate for exams in Scotland fell last week - but was still higher than before the pandemic. The fall in top grades will mean disappointment for some students, but it has got nothing to do with students\' individual performance. It is part of a plan to bring grades back down in line with pre-pandemic levels, after sharp rises in 2020 and 2021 when exams were cancelled and results were based on teachers\' assessments. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) said 79% of 18-year-olds applying to university got a place at their first choice - which is lower than last year, but higher than before the pandemic. Another 9% did not get into their firm or insurance choice of university and are in clearing, Ucas\'s online system that advertises courses with vacancies. Ucas has previously warned that spaces on some courses at top universities would "go quite quickly" in clearing, with the number of 18-year-olds in the population growing and international applications to undergraduate courses up slightly on last year. AS-level results are also being released which, in Wales and Northern Ireland, count towards students\' final A-level results next summer. And 3,448 students in England are receiving vocational T-level qualifications in England. The pass rate was 90.5%, and 69.2% of students achieved a merit or above. By Christina McSorley and Rahib Khan, education reporters Lara, 18, is planning to move out of her family home in London and head to university in the next few weeks. She was disappointed when she did not get the grades she wanted in her English literature, maths and computer science A-levels - but has since found a place through clearing. "Luckily my parents and my teacher were on hand to offer me support and we got on the phone to clearing immediately," she said. "Everyone should be proud of what they have achieved and remember, if you don\'t get the grades you want there are still so many options available to you." Lara is a registered young carer for her younger sister, and says moving to university does "bring up some anxieties". "I\'ll still be available to phone and pop down to visit, but there is that anxiety that I will be leaving and I\'m not sure how either of us will react to that situation," she said. With the support of her parents and family and the Carers Trust charity, Lara says she is ready to take the next step and would encourage other young carers to reach out and get some help. "Hollie, my sister, would like to turn my room into a Lego room when I leave," she says. "She is very excited." There was a steeper drop in the proportion of A-levels marked at A* and A in England than elsewhere: Exams were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of Covid. Pupils\' grades were based on teachers\' predictions instead, leading to a spike in top results. England\'s exams watchdog, Ofqual, set out a two-year plan to bring A-level and GCSE results back down to pre-pandemic levels. Last year was the first time students sat exams since the start of the pandemic. Ofqual called it a "transition year", with grades set to reflect a midway point between 2019 and 2021. About 36.4% of A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were marked at A* and A. Now, in the second stage of the plan, grades in England are more similar to those in 2019, when 25.4% of A-levels were given the top grades. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said bringing them back down would ensure results carried "weight and credibility" with employers, universities and colleges, so they know what the different grades mean. However, this year\'s A-level students also suffered from disruption because of Covid. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said students getting A-level and other Level 3 results had faced "unprecedented circumstances". Most of them were in Year 10 when the pandemic hit and their GCSEs were cancelled, so this is the first time they have sat formal exams. The impact on pupils was not equal, and MPs have warned it could take a decade for the gap between disadvantaged pupils and others to narrow to what it was before Covid. These students have also faced disruption from teacher strikes this year, although unions said they tried to minimise the impact on exam year groups. The Covid disruption means things are not quite back to normal. Ofqual says there was "protection built into the grading process" so that students should achieve the grades they would have done if the pandemic had not happened - even if they did not perform as well in their exams. Some Covid measures also remained in place for this year\'s exams. A-levels were spaced apart more than they were before the pandemic, allowing for rest and revision. But, unlike in the rest of the UK, A-level students in England were not given advance information about the topics on which they would be tested. The Higher Education Policy Institute said this week that "England has probably got it wrong" by trying to get back to normal "too quickly". Jo Saxton, the head of Ofqual, told the BBC that students in England would not be disadvantaged because universities had been pre-warned that different nations were taking different approaches.

More than 60 people are feared to have died on the boat, which was at sea for over a month. Most were from Senegal. "Everyone is shocked. He was one of the pillars of our family," Mamour Ba said about his brother Cheikhouna. But the 27-year-old said he would still attempt the trip himself as it was impossible to make a living in Senegal. Mr Ba, 27, is a student from the small fishing town of Fass Boye, halfway along the coast between the capital, Dakar, and the historical town of St Louis. Three of his brothers and one of his cousins were on the wooden pirogue style boat that set off for Europe on 10 July from Fass Boye with 101 people on board. "They wanted to get to Spain. They said they wanted to leave and I couldn\'t tell them not to because they\'d already made their minds up." He thought they had all died, until he got a call from Cape Verde on Wednesday after their rescue. They were among 38 people, including children, who were saved, with footage showing them being helped ashore, some on stretchers, on the island of Sal. More than 60 other people are feared to be lost at sea. The archipelago sits around 600km (372 miles) off the coast of West Africa and on the migration route to the Canary Islands, a Spanish territory seen by many as a route to the EU. Mr Ba says he still does not know the details of his relatives\' five-week journey as they were too disorientated: "They didn\'t have the strength to explain what happened, they just said: \'We\'re alive\'. They sounded very weak." But as the conversation continued, he found out that not all of them had survived. "One of my brothers, Ibrahima, used one of the doctor\'s phones to call me from Cape Verde. "He told us our other brother Cheikhouna was lost at sea. I was shocked. We were very close, he was a real fighter. He was married with two kids. "The day he left he held my hands and said, \'Brother I have to go.\' "He was my brother, he was my friend." After news of the tragedy spread in Fass Boye, where most of those on board the boat hailed from, anger erupted on Wednesday. Some set fire to the house of the mayor, angered with the authorities about the lack of opportunities for young people. This frustration is something Mr Ba is all too familiar with - he has tried at least twice to leave Senegal. "There was nothing for me here... so I decided I needed to try to move to Europe via Morocco," he said, speaking of his first attempt during his third year at university. Things did not work out though, and he was forced to return home after spending nine months there. But he was determined to achieve his dream of moving to Europe - and tried again, this time just a few weeks ago, at the end of June, with Cheikhouna. But the attempt failed. "This latest trip was Cheikhouna\'s second attempt at getting to Europe by boat. Three days after we came back, he had set off again," Mr Ba said. "He was determined to leave because he had a family and there\'s nothing for us here in Senegal. "We\'re fishermen, we work all day and we make no money. He just wanted to feed his family and have a better life." Mr Ba knows it is risky to try to board another boat to Europe, but it comes down to finances. "I don\'t have the money to take a plane. It\'s better to pay 300,000 CFA ($480, £375) or 400,000 CFA to go to Spain than to spend millions trying to get there by plane." He says he is not scared of drowning. "Others have done this journey and have drowned but it doesn\'t put me off. It\'s a risk I\'m willing to take. Even if there was a boat ready to go today, I\'d take it."

Six men died after the vessel they were aboard got into difficulty near Calais on Saturday. More than 50 other people were rescued by French and British coastguards. French judges are also reportedly considering further charges against the Iraqi and Sudanese suspects. At least two of those detained are thought to have links to human trafficking networks, according to French media. The people on board were reported to be mainly Afghan, with some Sudanese also present. Karim was one of about 10 people who was turned away from boarding the vessel due to overcrowding, despite paying people smugglers €2,000 ($2,200; £1,700) for a place. He told the BBC the smugglers promised him a "good boat" - something at least 10m (32ft) long - but what they were given was only 3m long. Two of his friends were allowed aboard and Karim thinks they were among those who died. Another man, Idris, managed to survive the journey but has ended up back in France. "There were far too many passengers," the 22-year-old told the Reuters news agency. "The waves were very strong, and the boat split up. "Half the passengers fell into the water and were swallowed up by the sea. Those who were left in the boat tried to stay alive with the help of their lifebuoys." Rescue workers on Saturday said it was the seventh time that week that they had pulled people from the water, raising concerns that the smugglers organising the crossings may be using a defective batch of boats. The English Channel is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, with 600 tankers and 200 ferries passing through it every day. Despite this, many people are willing to take the risk. Figures released on Thursday show more than 17,000 migrants have arrived in the UK so far this year after crossing the Channel. More than 400 people arrived in small boats on Wednesday alone. The BBC also spoke to Zhala in Calais, who said she was fleeing gun attacks in Iraq with her young family. They have repeatedly tried to get on a boat. "It\'s fate," she said when asked what she thought about Saturday\'s sinking. "It\'s not dangerous for us. We\'ve come across so many difficulties in my country." A migrant from South Sudan, who has set up a camp hidden in the bushes on the coastline, told the BBC he was adamant to get to the UK to make a success of himself. He said: "[The UK} colonised me in Sudan, that\'s why. It\'s like my father." Explaining why he wants to leave Sudan, he explained he was leaving because of war and corruption. But French authorities have threatened to move him and his fellow countryman from their makeshift camp, he added. Karim said he is also still looking to try and make it across into the UK. Aid workers in Calais say more migrants have been arriving in recent weeks and have been living rough on the coastline. They say many of them are determined to get to the UK, despite warnings over the dangers of the crossing.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

A divorce petition filed late on Wednesday, seen by BBC News, cites "irreconcilable differences" between Asghari, 29, and Spears, 41. The couple got engaged in September 2021 and were married in a small but star-studded ceremony in June 2022. But rumours of their marital struggles have been splashed across US tabloids this year. Representatives for Spears and Asghari have not yet commented. The musician did not address the divorce in a Wednesday night post to her 42 million Instagram followers, instead writing that she was "buying a horse soon". According to the dissolution of marriage petition filed by Asghari in Los Angeles County Superior Court, he asks that spousal support and attorneys\' fees be paid by Spears. The Iranian-American actor, model and fitness trainer met Spears while she was shooting the video for her song, Slumber Party, in 2016. He played a key role during her conservatorship fight with father Jamie, sporting a Free Britney T-shirt on Instagram before a crucial court hearing. Their wedding, at the superstar\'s home in Thousand Oaks, California last year, was an intimate and lavish affair attended by celebrities including Paris Hilton, Madonna and Drew Barrymore. The two had recently been seen without their wedding rings in public. The separation comes as Spears prepares to publish her memoir - The Woman in Me - this October. It marks the end of her third marriage. In 2004, she married childhood friend Jason Alexander for 55 hours in Las Vegas, before she annulled the nuptials at the urging of her management team. Mr Alexander, who was seen participating in the pro-Trump riot at the US Capitol in Washington DC in January 2021, attempted to crash Spears\' wedding to Asghari hours before they tied the knot. He was charged with trespassing, vandalism and two counts of battery, and has been court ordered to stay away from her. Spears\' second marriage - to rapper Kevin Federline - lasted from 2004 to 2007. Federline retains sole custody of their two children, Jayden James and Sean Preston.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

In a statement to his Instagram account on Thursday, the actor, 29, wrote: 'After 6 years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together.' He continued: 'We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always,' adding: 'S**t happens.' 'Asking for privacy seems ridiculous so I will just ask for everyone including media to be kind and thoughtful.' The latest update comes amid reports the Toxic singer, 41, got physical with Asghari several times and once gave him a black eye as he slept. Asghari reportedly told friends that the pop princess would attack him during their seven years together, sources told TMZ, adding there were numerous fights where security had to step in between the pair. The model was reportedly left stunned after his then-wife started punching him as he was sleeping in their bed. He was pictured with bruising on his arms and face earlier this year, with sources saying the dates coincide with the alleged attack. Sources claim that Asghari was concerned with the Toxic star's fascination with knives, which were littered across the singer's $11.8 million home in Thousand Oaks, California. One told TMZ that Britney was 'was paranoid someone was going to get her, and she needed the knives as protection.' The star is also accused of 'flying off the handle' at the smallest things, which left Asghari terrified. Insiders on Thursday told TMZ that Asghari had suspected that the Grammy-winning singer had cheated on him with a staffer at the Southern California home they shared; and that video footage shot on the property implicates Spears in being unfaithful. Asghari was suspicious that the Womanizer vocalist - described by sources as being in 'a fragile and hyper-sexualized state' - had also asked a staffer to film her while she was naked. Spears' alleged behavior was described by a source to the outlet as risky 'to her own safety;' and that her infidelity was what persuaded Asghari to move forward in his divorce filing. The latest details in the split come after DailyMail.com revealed that their relationship had descended into a dark and desperate state in the final weeks of their union. Sources revealed how Asghari thought he could 'save her', only to realize after 13 months of marriage that here may well be no chance of ever 'saving Britney.' 'The reality of life with Britney was that it was not fun and it's not a surprise at all that the marriage didn't last,' the insider shared. Asghari cited 'irreconcilable differences' when he filed for divorce from the singer - as sources claim that he felt he couldn't leave Spears alone. According to court docs, Asghari is asking the multi-millionaire for spousal support and to cover his attorneys fees. DailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for Britney for comment. Asghari's lawyer Neal Hersh said that their finances need to be determined — despite the couple having an 'iron clad' prenup in place that protects the singer's premarital assets. The prenup stated that he was entitled to '$1 million per every two years' of their marriage, with a cap at $10 million after 15 years, according to US Weekly. He has also allegedly waived any claims to Britney's music collection, and his name is not listed on the deeds of their shared home. Spears raised eyebrows on Sunday when she posted a bizarre video of herself dancing on a stripper pole in a skimpy leopard-print lingerie set after the news of their breakup became public. In the since-deleted video, the hitmaker was dancing in the raunchy clip to Nine Inch Nails' X-rated song Closer, a classic of edgy dance and industrial music. She was spotted for the first time since the split, behind the wheel of her white Mercedes-Benz as she drove around in Los Angeles. Her ring-free hand was displayed as she steered the wheel of her luxury vehicle down a winding road near her Thousand Oaks home. Britney has yet to comment on the divorce news, but she did break her silence by sharing a bizarre Instagram post about vowing to buy a horse 'soon.' Since tying the knot in 2022, Britney has added to her fortune by signing a $15 million deal with publishing house Simon & Schuster for a tell-all memoir titled The Woman In Me. But it could be that the book may serve as a reminder for another failed relationship, with the happy ending of their marriage meant to serve as an important narrative. The star also returned to music by releasing two new singles, a new version of Tiny Dancer with Elton John, and Mind Your Business with will.i.am. Page Six reported that Britney has hired celebrity divorce attorney Laura Wasser — who boasts A-list clients such as Kim Kardashian, Kevin Costner and Johnny Depp. But it's been alleged that Asghari is threatening to release 'extraordinarily embarrassing' information about his spouse if she refuses to renegotiate the terms — something a source close to Spears told DailyMail.com is 'absurd.' She previously enlisted Wasser's help in 2008 as she fought her ex-husband Kevin Federline, 45, over custody of their two sons. The exes — who split in 2006 after two years of marriage — share Jayden James, 16, and Sean Preston, 17. A judge ordered Spears to pay $20,000 a month in child support — a decision that Wasser said the Piece Of Me hitmaker felt 'great' about. The monthly payments reportedly increased to $60,000 in 2018 and Kevin has full custody of the boys. He reportedly moved the family to Hawaii last month, without saying goodbye to Britney. Wasser is huge proponent for prenups regardless of wealth status as she believes marrying someone is the 'biggest decision of your life.'

Walker had just taken a bite when her husband, Borhan, announced he no longer wanted to be married. She had icing sugar on her face and assumed it was a joke — but he was perfectly serious. There had been no fighting, no arguments — but he wanted out. Walker had form when it came to break-ups, having already 'left God'. Raised in the Baha'i Faith (which believes in the unity and equality of humanity, and in one God), she married at 20, had sex for the first time on her wedding night, and didn't touched a drop of alcohol ('not even in a plum pudding') until she was 28. Unlike her husband, who 'left God like Noel Gallagher left Oasis', Walker's faith gradually ebbed away into a state of doubt. She maintained a facade with her family — not swearing, smoking or drinking when she was with them, making excuses not to participate in Faith activities. She stepped away so stealthily no one suspected she'd left her religion. Aged 35, unmoored by the end of not one relationship but two, Walker packed up her three children and moved to a rental: adrift in a 'sea of unbelieving'. But this is not, she says, a book about divorce or God. (Not entirely, anyway.) 'Like everything else, this is about love.' Lost and bewildered Walker may be when we first meet her, but she comes from a family with an extraordinary capacity for love. Her memoir reads like a novel — a sprawling, intimate, intergenerational family saga. And what a family. Warm, wise and anchored by not one but five strong women: Walker's grandmother, Dolly; her mother, Fari; and her remarkable aunties, Mehri, Irie and Mona, who dispense love, well-intentioned advice, and chai in equal measure. It is a family of cousins who feel like siblings, full of whispered intimacies and unspoken, affectionate shorthand. Walker's own story is a springboard into the family's past as she skates elegantly between generations and around the globe. She takes us from Tehran in 1946, where widowed Dolly cleans, sews and scrimps to keep her five children to India in 1952, where a terrified Fari cowers in a mulberry tree, chanting a magic prayer against a black panther. In 1966, Dolly and her daughters flee heartbreak, in search of a new life in Australia where, in 1980s Toowoomba, four-year-old Sita — her parents' fourth child, her father's 'precious treasure' — eats chapatis and begs Dolly to sing You Are My Sunshine yet again. Intertwined throughout is the ending of Walker's marriage. After Borhan's declaration over that vanilla slice, they drift towards a civilised separation until, in 2015, they mark their divorce by taking hallucinogenic drugs together in the forest. A novel approach which certainly promises more excitement than arguing in a lawyer's office. This, Borhan tells her, will allow them to subconsciously uncouple. In her drug-induced state Walker sees her family's souls as elements. And, suddenly, she understands: she is fire and so is he. Together they are 'too much fire'. Little wonder their relationship is a 'ravaged' landscape. The matriarchs gather her to their collective bosom. Her students — she is clearly an excellent and loved English teacher — notice that she is different and shyly offer their sympathy. And then there is a new love affair — with Anthony, a kind, interesting, charming actor, who kisses 'like Joseph Fiennes in Shakespeare In Love'. (This quality is accorded the reverence it warrants.) Walker has an eagle ear for dialogue, an eye for absurdity, and is drolly self-deprecating. She tells us that this is 'no post-divorce Eat, Pray, Love'. But on a more modest scale, it is — as told by Nora Ephron. Food is offered as comfort incarnate, there is faith and there is an abundance of love. Walker realises she must listen to the women who raised her for the fate of her soul. In the words of redoubtable Aunty Mona, take the fear from her heart and fill it with love. For that, and only that, is the answer.", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Jessica Horne, 33, also racially abused a cabin crew member while flying on a Ryanair jet from Fuerteventura to Manchester in March 2022. Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court heard how Horne - who has three previous convictions for attacking police - had been drinking all day before boarding the 8pm flight and had also bought a bottle of Grey Goose vodka to drink on board. Lisa Boocock, prosecuting, said that mid way through the flight an 'intoxicated' Horne, who was travelling with her partner and their young son, was spotted vaping in her seat. A male member of crew 'told her to stop five times' and eventually took the vape from her. He then guided Horne, who'd got into an argument with her partner, to the rear of the aircraft to calm her down but it had 'little effect', Ms Boocock said. Her partner was so concerned about her behaviour he spoke to the crew member while a 'Good Samaritan' gave up their seat in a further attempt to calm the situation. Horne, of Briercliffe, Burnley, then started to touch the crew member and tried to kiss him on the cheek, the court heard. She also demanded he return her vape, grabbed him and stroked his name badge, leaving him 'feeling uncomfortable'. When the crew member - who is of Fillipino origin - refused, Horne racially abused him calling him a 'f****** c****' and a 'cheeky c****' several times. She also told him: 'Go back home'. The crew member was left so 'distressed', Ms Boocock said, he asked the captain to divert the plane but 'that wasn't practical' and he described the incident as the 'worst he'd ever had' with a passenger in four years of flying. Fortunately, Horne fell asleep 40 minutes before the flight was due to land and was arrested by police when the plane touched down. But she spat at one officer and punched and scratched another, leaving her with a black eye and cut to the top of her eyelid. She also swore at them, calling them: 'C****.' In a victim impact statement, the female officer said she expected to deal with intoxicated people but the attack had left her explaining her injuries to her family who were already 'fearful' about her role. It had affected her confidence, she said, and she couldn't understand why she had been assaulted when she was just trying to do her job. The court heard Horne has a number of previous convictions for similar offences. In February 2017, she was handed a 12-week curfew after racially abusing a taxi driver and a police officer, who she kicked in the shins. But the curfew was later lifted so she could could attend a weekend Centre Parcs holiday to celebrate her mum's 60th birthday. A few months later she attacked two police officers, kicking one in his privates and labelling his female colleague a 'lesbian c***', but was given a conditional discharge by magistrates. In 2018, she walked free from court again for carrying out a third attack on a police officer. For the latest incident, Horne pleaded guilty to charges of being drunk on an aircraft, two counts of assaulting an emergency worker and of racially aggravated harassment. The prosecution chose to offer no evidence on a fifth charge of sex assault, which will lie on file. Christian Kavanagh, defending, said Horne had made 'drastic changes in her character to address her behaviour' and was 'disgusted' by her actions. She acknowledged the impact it had on other passengers, he said, and she had a 'clear motivation' to address her issues. The court heard Horne's drinking had escalated during a previous abusive relationship, which resulted in her partner being jailed twice. The judge, Mr Recorder Imran Shafi KC, said Horne had a 'huge problem with alcohol' and labelled her behaviour 'disgraceful'. He said she had acted like she was on 'private flight and could behave how she felt' and not on a Ryanair holiday flight with other passengers 'who had to put up with your behaviour for four hours'. The judge described her attacks of the two police officers as 'thuggery' and said he had considered jailing her but was mindful she had three children aged 3, 9 and ten. Therefore, he decided to hand Horne an 18-month sentence, suspended for two years, and imposed 90-day rehabilitation order of alcohol abatement and monitoring. Horne was also ordered to pay the female police officer £1,000 in compensation.", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Think again. A powerful new book by a former prison officer argues jail time neither punishes nor rehabilitates — and leaves some inmates in such despair they seek the only way out...", 'byline': 'PETER HITCHENS FOR THE DAILY MAIL', 'time': '2023-08-17T22:01:24+0100', 'text': "BOOK OF THE WEEK BEHIND THESE DOORS by Alex South (Hodder & Stoughton £16.99, 352pp) Most people have pretty strong feelings about what prisons should be like. Hardly anyone knows what they are like. Half the population is convinced they are holiday camps where unrepentant villains feast on smuggled fillet steaks. The other half thinks they are unjust hellholes whose inmates should for the most part be let out. Neither of these beliefs is correct. The truth is in some ways quite a lot worse. The miserable result of this empty controversy is that nothing intelligent is ever done about our jails. So they grow worse. And we will pay for this. As experienced officers retire, there will be violence and chaos will increase. And it will be unendurable to think that there are innocent people in there, at the mercy of unrestrained savagery. For there are. Alex South — a brave young woman who became a prison officer — endured danger, misery and near-despair, and has written a superb, compelling book about these experiences. Everyone should read it. It is not what you might expect. Though the complex issue of female officers in male prisons is touched on quite a lot, it is not really a huge part of the book. It is fairly obvious that these officers can do a lot of good, but sometimes at great peril to themselves. South is a likeable and candid guide to this dark world. Perhaps her strongest message is this. It is upon the prison officers — patient, thoughtful, courageous, diplomatic and stoical — that the safety and peace of our prisons chiefly depend. Yet they simply do not have the public esteem which is still — often unjustifiably — given to the police. Instead, many of them go quietly crazy with the things they have to do. Now, the older, experienced men (perhaps guessing what is to come) are leaving and, as she warns: 'A storm is coming'. South was not fooled by the criminals she watched over, nor beguiled or tricked by them. She knew the terrible things they had done to others and sometimes tried to do to her. She was subjected to a vile false accusation, she was covered in blood and she was knocked unconscious in a dreadful fight. Yet she tried to do good, even when it was thankless, to people who most of us would cross the street to avoid. She and her fellow officers also sought to sustain human kindness, and to prevent harm, injury and death. They did not always succeed. If this book is right, they will succeed even less in the future. A hundred years ago, a fiercely moral society believed that prisons were for 'the due punishment of responsible persons', and there was little or no pretence that they were there to try to make people better. Beds were hard, discipline was hard, work was hard; the cells were cold and the food basic. Warders, as they were then called, were in charge. Now, all that is lost. But it has not been replaced by the liberal paradise which 1960s reformers presumably hoped for. For one thing, our softer prisons are far fuller — because they no longer deter the borderline cases from committing crime. In 1961, before Home Secretary Roy Jenkins diluted the criminal justice system, there were 27,000 prisoners in England and Wales, in drug-free prisons, more or less totally controlled by the authorities. Nowadays, there are around 80,000, in prisons swirling with drugs and weapons, where a pitifully small number of officers try to keep control, and increasingly fail. The alarming descriptions of sudden violent explosions in South's book are a warning of the future. Not long before she decides to leave, she writes: 'I can't guarantee a prisoner's safety. There's too much in the way. The phones and drugs and weapons and gangs and bullying. I can't guarantee anyone's safety. I can't guarantee my own.' In theory, we are trying to 'rehabilitate' those inside. In truth, we neither punish nor rehabilitate. Life in prison is a series of humiliations and deprivations, just as bad in their own way as the bread and water and porridge of the Victorian age — squalid accommodation, dreary food, the forced company in shared cells of people you would normally avoid with all your might.Plus an endless undercurrent of violence and menace made far worse by drugs and weapons. No wonder so many prisoners try to take the quick way out by hanging themselves. If you think we have abolished capital punishment, think again. We have it in large quantities — with despair doing regular service as the hangman. In one week, South records cutting down three hanged men. One died. One was revived but suffered permanent brain damage. Another was saved, but yelled at her, over and over again, 'Let me die!' Yet while some prefer death to prison, many offenders are barely touched by jail. They are not afraid of it. Actual served sentences are often shorter than the rehab courses the criminals are asked to undergo. The feebleness of police and courts means that many criminals do not enter prison until they have already committed so many crimes they can neither be deterred nor turned into better people. Anyway, how would modern British prisons turn their inhabitants into better people? There is little evidence that they do. Wormwood Scrubs, West London's vast Victorian jail, was clearly the worst (and most typical) experience of South's time in the prison service. She was surrounded by drugs, violence was almost normal, some prisoners were so far out of their minds — almost certainly due to drugs — that they plainly ought to have been in mental hospitals. The place was filthy, with rats everywhere. Basic security was so poor she actually witnessed a drone delivering two Big Macs to a cell window before swooping off into the London darkness. But next time, you see, it could be delivering a knife", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Sources claim the Mission: Impossible star hasn't visited the religion's UK headquarters for three years despite being based in Britain for most of that time", 'byline': 'ALISON BOSHOFF', 'time': '2023-08-17T22:00:35+0100', 'text': "Tom Cruise is Scientology's most famous member, but could he be losing his fervour? The actor was close friends with its leader David Miscavige, who was best man at his wedding to Katie Holmes in 2006, but sources say he has not flown his helicopter to Scientology's UK HQ in East Grinstead for around three years. During that time Cruise, 61, has been based mainly in the UK, making Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One, and has taken the chopper around the country, including to Birmingham and the Cotswolds. But not to East Grinstead - although Scientology does have a branch in Central London, which the actor could be attending. Spokesmen for Cruise and the church did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Scientology's UK HQ is Saint Hill Manor, in West Sussex, which was bought by the religion's founder L. Ron Hubbard in 1959 and was his family home before it was turned into a church. According to Scientology's website it 'provides advanced religious services to Scientologists from around the world'. Previously, Cruise had been in the habit of nipping down to West Sussex in his AS350 helicopter to visit the church. He has a pied-a-terre in London's Knightsbridge and would fly out of nearby Battersea heliport (where he was sometimes filmed by fans). Cruise's daughter Bella (from his marriage to second wife Nicole Kidman) lives in Croydon and is understood to work at Saint Hill, where there are around 400 staff. (Cruise and Kidman's son Connor is a game fisherman and cook who lives in Clearwater, Florida, where the religion has its global HQ.) Cruise's third wife, Katie Holmes, lives in New York with daughter Suri, 17. Neither she nor Kidman are Scientologists but Cruise's first wife, Mimi Rogers, was - and she introduced him to the religion, which he joined in 1986. It was reported in July 2021 that Cruise was 'drifting away' from the religion, as he had not been seen around Saint Hill Manor despite being in the country for filming work. Sources indicated that he had previously stayed at the manor on such occasions, although the change was attributed to concerns over gatherings during Covid. The UK Church of Scientology is small: the 2021 census showed fewer than 2,000 people in England and Wales described themselves as Scientologists. By contrast, over 8,000 said they believed in Shamanism.", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Gender is complex and not limited to "male" or "female". Furthermore, naming conventions vary by culture and individual preference, so it is not always possible to accurately determine the gender of a person by their name alone.

The hugely popular star and ex-cricket umpire Dickie shared memories in one of their regular phone calls. But that evening Parky passed following a brief illness. Dickie, 90, revealed: “I just can’t believe it. I only spoke to him on Wednesday. He was a true friend. “We talked about some of the moments of the happy times we spent together. “And I think he knew that he was coming to the end . . . we said our goodbyes.” Dickie, who was seen fighting back tears on Sky TV, also told Times Radio: “Our fathers worked down the coalmines. “Parky’s dad would have been very proud of his son. He was the best. “There will never be another like him. He never lost his love for cricket. It was his first love.” Parky’s death was announced in a statement this morning which said: “After a brief illness Sir Michael Parkinson passed away peacefully at home last night in the company of his family.” Parky was married to Mary, 87, for 64 years and the couple shared three sons. He interviewed the world’s \xadbiggest names on his self-titled show from 1971 — once estimating his total guests at 2,000. The programme was the highlight of Saturday nights. And today stars from screen, sport and politics paid tribute to the broadcaster whose TV career spanned seven decades. An opening batsman in his youth, Parky once kept England star Sir Geoffrey Boycott out of his hometown Barnsley cricket team. He had trials for Yorkshire and while he never cracked the first team like his two pals, the trio remained friends for life. Sir Geoffrey, 82, remembered Parky as the “soul of Yorkshire”. He said: “He was the best chat host because he listened to people. “He never lost his roots. Michael was Yorkshire in every way. “He understood how we think, how we talk. He was just a lovely man. He would laugh about himself with the emu. “He never lost his humour, his warmth, his Yorkshire in him that made him great.” One of Parky’s most memorable shows was his 1976 interview with comic Rod Hull and his pugnacious puppet Emu. Emu repeatedly pecked at Parky after he asked Rod: “Why is it so aggressive?”, leaving the chat host on the floor and missing a shoe. Parky later joked his career would always be remembered for “that bloody bird”. Millions watched his four punchy chats with boxing champ Muhammad Ali, and Parky later described him as the most extraordinary person he had ever met. Sir David Attenborough was interviewed by Parky many times and said today: “With Michael, it was always friendly, always thorough, always intelligent, always a pleasure to do it, and I think that came over no matter who his interviewee was.” Acting great Michael Caine added: “Michael Parkinson was irreplaceable, he was charming, always wanted to have a good laugh. “He brought the best of everyone he met. Always looked forward to be interviewed by him.” The chats didn’t always go well. In 1975 Parky suggested to Dame Helen Mirren, then 30, her “equipment” hindered her being recognised as a serious actress — leading to a frosty interview. In 2003 US actress Meg Ryan took offence at questions about her new film and gave one-word answers. When a desperate Parky asked what she’d do if giving the interview, she snapped: “Wrap it up.” He later called her “an unhappy woman”, while Ryan called him a “nut” and said he had spoken to her “like a disapproving dad”. Parky had faced health battles in recent years. In 2013 he revealed he had prostate cancer, but said he got the all-clear from doctors two years later. Five years ago he had to learn to walk again following back surgery. News of his death earlier today triggered an outpouring of affection. Writer Stephen Fry said: “Loved that man. “Having grown up watching him interview greats, my first appearance was impossibly thrilling for me. “The genius of Parky was that unlike most people he was always 100 per cent himself.” Match of the Day’s Gary Lineker said: “A truly brilliant broadcaster and wonderful interviewer. “He was very much part of Saturday nights growing up: Parkinson then Match of the Day. RIP Parky.” Superstar Sir Elton John said: “Michael Parkinson was a TV legend who was one of the greats.” TalkTV presenter Piers Morgan said: “Wonderful character, great writer, sublimely talented broadcaster, and hilarious lunch partner. Loved him.” Parky was born in 1935 in the pit village of Cudworth, South Yorks. He left school with two O-levels and got a job collating sports results on his local newspaper. He did a two-year military stint becoming the British Army’s youngest captain at the age of 20. Parky returned to journalism then switched to television as a current affairs presenter and reporter for Granada in the 1960s. US jazz singer Marion Montgomery was the first guest in 1971. The show initially ran for 11 years and in 1998 Parky returned to the BBC for another run. The show switched to ITV from 2004-7 and he was knighted the following year. In a 2004 chat with Aussie comic Barry Humphries, dressed as his character Dame Edna Everage, one saucy comment made Parky laugh so much he had to cut to an ad break. In all he filmed 650 episodes over 32 years, regularly pulling in nine million viewers. Of his guests, Parky said Scots comedian Sir Billy Connolly was the funniest, Tommy Cooper “either the brightest or silliest” and David Beckham and George Clooney “the best-looking”. Connolly found overnight fame when a taxi driver gave Parky a tape of one of his stand-up shows and persuaded him to have Billy as a guest. He went on to appear 15 times, including the last episode. Speaking of his style, Parky once said: “It doesn’t really matter how famous', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Carly and Adam Taylor, who face a police quiz over the suspected arson attack, flew to the Greek holiday island yesterday. They are staying at a £20,000-a-week villa near Corfu Town. Meanwhile Staffordshire Police said they would be “speaking to the owners” about the fire which destroyed the Crooked House. Questions have also been raised over the pub’s demolition just 36 hours after the August 5 blaze. The pub was sold by Marston’s Brewery last month to ATE Farms Limited, a firm controlled by former hairdresser and nail technician Carly, 34. It had been listed for sale for £675,000. Husband Adam, 44, is shareholder and ex-director of Himley Environmental Ltd which runs a landfill site next door to the pub in the village of Himley, Staffs. The couple’s Corfu break follows a recent trip to Dubai. Carly was seen dressed casually in black jogging bottoms, T-shirt and baseball cap at the airport. Adam, in shorts and T-shirt, was heard on his phone moaning about media coverage of the fire. Their five-bedroom holiday villa has two swimming pools, gym, tennis court, barbecue and pool table and boasts incredible sea and mountain views. It is understood the Taylors are due to stay for a week before returning to the UK to deal with the fallout from the pub blaze. They are current and former directors of 18 companies mainly involved in waste management and property development. Mystery still surrounds the pub fire after intruders were reportedly seen before it broke out. Staffordshire Police said in a statement that the force is investigating “all of the available evidence into the cause” of the fire with Staffordshire Fire and Rescue and no cause had yet been established. Meanwhile lawyers for South Staffordshire council are looking into potential breaches of the Town and Country Planning Act over the pub’s demolition. It has emerged the 18th century boozer, where coins and marbles famously rolled uphill along the bar, was put forward for listed status protection just days before it burnt down. If granted, the owners would have needed council permission for demolition. It has also been claimed the mechanical digger that demolished the charred ruins of the pub was hired before the blaze. Lyndon Thomas, the boss of the plant firm that owns the excavator, said his firm had delivered it days before the fire. Built in 1765 as a farmhouse, The Crooked House became a pub in the 19th century and got its name after subsidence from mining in the area caused the building’s distinctive 16-degree tilt. Earlier this month it was reported Mr Taylor was stopped from stripping another pub in nearby Willey, Warks. He is said to have ripped out the interior of the Sarah Mansfield Country Inn, bought from a brewery in 2020.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The Prince of Wales and the Prime Minister are to miss the match in Sydney, Australia, despite it being the Lionesses’ first appearance in the final. It comes as Spain’s Queen Letizia revealed she would be heading Down Under. Yesterday, Kensington Palace confirmed Prince William, who is president of the FA, would be roaring on the Lionesses from home. William is believed to be against the 9,400-mile flight as he wants to keep down his carbon footprint. The Prime Minister will also miss England’s first World Cup final since 1966, sending Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer instead. Royal expert Phil Dampier tweeted: “If Prince William as president of the FA isn’t going to the Women’s World Cup final we should be told why not. "If it was in Europe, he’d be there.” Mandu Reid, leader of the Women’s Equality Party, added: “No chance Prince William would be ‘missing in action’ if the England men’s football team made it to the World Cup final.” It comes as the Government faces calls to announce a day off if the Lionesses beat Spain.

The group, fronted by Chris Martin, had their career steered by Dave Holmes for almost their entire time as a band but now it has been revealed they secretly split last year. Now things have turned messy, as a lawsuit has been filed here in the UK as part of a contractual dispute. Coldplay was formed in 1997 after the group met as students at the University College of London. They are currently on their Music Of Spheres world tour and are in talks to play Glastonbury next year. The slot, which will be a headline performance on the Pyramid stage, would mark the 25th anniversary of their first performance at Worthy Farm. Although their last proper performance there was in 2016, Chris went for fun in 2017 and joined Kylie Minogue and Stormzy on stage during their sets in 2019. Then in 2021, the group performed a set as part of Glastonbury’s Live At Worthy Farm livestream after the festival was cancelled due to lockdown restrictions. They will also have a new album out by then, called Moon Music, with Chris teasing that it’s due “early next year.” Speaking about the record, and comparisons to their last LP, he said: “I wouldn’t say it’s a sequel but it’s related. It’s its own thing but it will be part of this same tour. It’s like a cousin. “We take a studio with us on tour. That’s the amazing thing about making records now is you can make them everywhere. I always go to the studio on days off. That’s my hobby.” Asked if it would feature collaborations, he continued: “I don’t know. That’s still to be decided. “I think we’re approaching collaborations slightly differently this time. But I’m really enjoying working on it.” He has also doubled down on the claim that the group will only ever release three more albums. Speaking in Italy, he added: “I just have a strong feeling in my heart that we are supposed to do 12 projects and that feels really right. “But after that we’d still like to do shows and tours. I think 12 albums is a lot.”', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The two gliders smashed into each other just after 3pm today in the skies above Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. One of the gliders crashed yards from a housing estate in the west of the town. Witness David Leach told the BBC: "I came out and we just looked up watching them circle right above us. "Then, all of a sudden, there was a mighty bang. "I think the end of the wing of one clipped the back end of one glider, chopping his tail end off - and one of them just came crashing down like a rocket." No details of any injuries have yet been released. The Air Accidents Investigations Branch said: "We have launched an investigation into a glider mid-air collision which occurred this afternoon near Melton Mowbray, Leicester. "We have deployed a team to the site." Another local said the pilot of one of the gliders walked across the field before knocking on her door. She said the unhurt pilot was "very shaken and concerned about the other pilot". Leicestershire Police said cops had scrambled to the crash site along with firefighters and ambulance crew. A spokeswoman for the housing estate said: "We can confirm that an incident took place on our Roundhouse Park site in Melton Mowbray involving a light aircraft. "We can confirm that all of the site staff are accounted for and there have been no reports of injuries on the ground.
