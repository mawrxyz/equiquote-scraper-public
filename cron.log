The inflation rate, measuring price changes over time, fell to 6.8% in the year to July, down from 7.9% in June. Lower electricity and gas prices drove the drop, but price rises in other areas have led to expectations that interest rates will be raised further. The cost of eating out has risen, along with alcohol and tobacco prices. Flight prices continued to rise, jumping almost 30% compared to July last year, according to the official figures, released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Inflation is much lower than it was at its peak of 11.1% in October, but it still remains high compared to historical rates and much higher than the Bank of England\'s 2% target. When the rate of inflation falls, it does not mean that prices are coming down, but that they are rising less quickly. Wages have been failing to keep up with rising prices for some time, but there are potential signs of change after figures on Tuesday revealed wages rose 7.8% annually between April and June. Alongside reductions in energy bills, price rises for staple food items like milk, butter, bread, eggs, cereal and fish eased. But overall, food still costs almost 15% more than one year ago. Matthew Corder, deputy director of prices at the ONS, said falling gas and electricity prices drove down inflation last month when a change to the energy price cap, which limits how much suppliers can charge households for what they use, came into force. While easing energy bills and food costs will be welcome for households, there "will be little cause for celebration" at the Bank of England, according to Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. "Inflation is still significantly above that 2% target and even if it is cooling off faster than a sunburnt Brit diving into a hotel pool, prices are not falling, they\'re just not rising as fast as they have been," she said. "Wage increases and price pressures have forced up service costs and that\'s weaving its own nasty spell on core inflation," she added. Core inflation, which strips out the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, remained unchanged in July at 6.9%. The rate is higher than in Germany, France, and the US and it is a figure that is closely watched by the Bank of England, which sets interest rates. With inflation still more than three times the Bank\'s 2% target, many experts expect it will raise interest rates again in September in an attempt to slow price rises. The Bank has steadily increased interest rates to 5.25%, the highest level in 15 years, meaning mortgage costs have jumped, but savings rates have also increased. Higher rates can also lead to high credit card and loan repayments. It hopes that if it makes borrowing more expensive, people will spend less, demand will slow, and prices will not rise as quickly. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said with wage growth and services inflation both stronger than the Bank had expected, its decision makers would look to raise rates from 5.25% to 5.5% in September. In the year to July, services inflation, which includes data on prices for services in venues like bars, hairdressers and restaurants was back up to 7.4%, the joint highest level since 1992. The ONS said price increases for hotels drove services inflation higher. At first glance, this sharp fall in the rate of inflation to below 7% puts the UK on a path to a more "normal" economic situation. However, the underlying measures of inflationary pressures across the economy, are no longer going in the right direction. Services inflation was back up to 7.4% - the joint highest level since 1992. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, remained at 6.9%. The significance of these measures is that they show how much inflation is left in the economy, after the direct impacts of the energy shock have passed through. This set of figures increase the likelihood of further interest rate rises in September and perhaps October too. While the prime minister has said there is "light at the end of the tunnel", Wednesday\'s figures confirm that we can see a tunnel out of this, but it may still be some time before the light is reached.

Feyisara, who runs the business with his wife, said a box of plantain costs between £35 and £40 compared to £16 five years ago, while prices for meat and beans and other imported ingredients have risen. He said he is fortunate to be on a busy street market with steady footfall, but fears if wholesale costs do not ease soon, the shop will have to put up its prices. "Everything\'s gone up but somehow we\'ve been able to absorb it," he said. "If they don\'t fall, we\'ll have to unfortunately increase our prices. So that the business can cope." Prime Minister Rishi Sunak defended his record on tackling the cost of living, saying the plan to ease rising prices was working. He said it was difficult for people to understand the scale of government support with energy bills. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said inflation in Britain remained "higher than many other major economies". "After 13 years of economic chaos and incompetence under the Conservatives, working people are worse off - with higher energy bills and prices in the shops," she said. Heidi Karjalainen, a research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested the government\'s pledge to halve inflation by the end of this year was "always a little odd as there is only so much the Treasury'}

With fewer properties available to rent in many areas, the mismatch between supply and demand has pushed up costs for many people. Prices paid by UK renters rose by 5.3% on average in the year to July, the Office for National Statistics said. The figures come as rising prices continues to squeeze household budgets. The inflation rate, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, fell to 6.8% in the year to July. Although this was down from 7.9% in June, it is still far above the Bank of England\'s target of 2%. High demand from tenants at the same time as landlords reducing the number of available properties is one of the key reasons behind the rent increase. Competition among renters is so intense that there are 20 requests to view each available property, according to recent figures commissioned by the BBC from property portal Rightmove, up from six in pre-pandemic 2019. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows UK average annual rent increases accelerated to 5.3% from 5.2% the previous month. There was a 5.5% increase in rents in London, which was the only region where house prices had fallen. This was the sharpest increase in rent since comparable records began for London in 2006. The same annual rent rise was recorded in the West Midlands as well as Yorkshire and the Humber. There were even bigger rises for tenants in Wales, where the average was up 6.5% in a year, and in Scotland (up 5.7%). In Northern Ireland, where the data is collected slightly differently, there was a 9.2% increase in the year to May, although this was lower than a previous peak. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agency Knight Frank, said: "The squeeze on tenants will not end any time soon." He said that there was more financial pain for tenants as the supply of rental property fell and rents rose. "It is an imbalance compounded by the fact landlords now face higher mortgage rates," he added. Official data on wages and inflation have led analysts to suggest that there could be further rises in the Bank of England\'s benchmark rate, which would mean ongoing pressure on landlords and homeowners through relatively high mortgage rates. Average UK house prices increased by 1.7% annually, down from a revised 1.8% rise in May, the ONS said, as the market cools as a result of the mortgage rate hikes.

Sara's body was found at her home in Woking, Surrey, on 10 August. The BBC has spoken to a travel agent in the town who said he was contacted by someone known to Sara, wanting tickets for three adults and five children. Police want to speak to three people known to Sara - who they have not named - and who left the UK on 9 August. Surrey Police launched a murder investigation after Sara's body was found alone in the family home 02:50 BST. Speaking to the BBC, the travel agent in Woking identified the person making the booking on the evening of 8 August to travel the following day, whom he said had used his services before. The BBC has spoken to police in Pakistan who have said that no formal approach has been made by the British authorities over the case. Pakistan and the UK do not have a formal extradition treaty. In an interview with the Sun newspaper Sara's mother spoke about her grief and disbelief that her daughter was dead. Olga Sharif was divorced from Sara's father, who had custody of the child. A post-mortem examination was due to be carried out yesterday (Tuesday) on the 10-year-old but a cause of death has not been formally confirmed."}

The prime minister said halving inflation was a top priority and his plan to ease rising prices was working. It comes as the latest figures showed inflation slowed last month due to lower energy costs. But food, restaurants and hotel costs are still rising. The inflation rate, which measures price changes over time, fell to 6.8% in the year to July, down from 7.9% in June. This means prices are rising less quickly. Inflation is much lower than it was at its peak of 11.1% in October, but it still remains high compared to historical rates and much higher than the Bank of England\'s 2% target. Speaking at a business event in Enderby, Leicestershire, Mr Sunak said that unlike furlough, where the government subsidised wages of employees hit by the Covid pandemic, "no one quite understands the scale of what we\'ve done" with energy bill support. "A typical family will have had about half their energy bills paid for by the government over past several months - that\'s worth £1,500 to a typical family," he said. "Now you wouldn\'t have quite seen that because you would have still just got your energy bill, it would have been very high and you\'d have been, \'Oh my gosh, what\'s going on\', but what you wouldn\'t have realised, maybe, is that before that even happened, £1,500 had been lopped off, and the government had covered it." Under the Energy Price Guarantee, the government limited energy bills for a typical household to £2,500 a year, alongside a £400 winter discount. However, the guarantee ended in July. The Liberal Democrats described Mr Sunak\'s comments as "woefully out of touch". The party\'s Cabinet Office spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: "Does he expect the public to give the Conservative Party a pat on the back for crashing the economy and adding hundreds of pounds a month to people\'s mortgages? "He just does not get it." Mr Sunak said his plan to halve inflation, by being "responsible" with spending and borrowing, was working. However, speaking to journalists at the same event, he said he was "not complacent" and knew "things are tough right now". The prime minister added that the government was also helping people by cutting fuel duty, capping bus fares outside London, and giving support payments to pensioners and people on Universal Credit. Labour\'s deputy leader Angela Rayner said the fall in inflation was a "relief" but prices were still going up, just at a lower rate. She blamed the Conservatives for "a decade of low growth, low pay and high taxes".'}

Jubilant Lionesses celebrate reaching first World Cup final with 3-1 win over Australia by dancing to Sweet Caroline in their dressing room - before Sarina Wiegman tells them to save their energy for the next game', 'byline': 'TOM PYMAN', 'time': '2023-08-16T15:38:08+0100', 'text': "The Lionesses celebrated reaching their maiden World Cup final, and England's first in nearly 60 years, by dancing to Sweet Caroline today - but there were only soft drinks in sight with one more step to go on the road to glory. The team's official Twitter account posted three images from behind the scenes in Sydney, following an historic 3-1 win over old rivals, Australia. It was captioned 'Good times never seemed so good!' - lyrics from the Neil Diamond classic which has become something of a celebratory anthem for England in recent tournaments. Goalscorers Lauren Hemp and Ella Toone led the jubilant scenes Down Under - but focus was clearly already turning to Sunday's final with Spain, as the players were pictured with cans of Fanta and Coke, rather than champagne. Boss Sarina Wiegman was clearly keen to keep a lid on celebrations, even telling defender Lucy Bronze to 'stop jumping' and to immediately begin preparations for Sunday's showpiece final. Reflecting on her coach's speech after the game, Bronze said: 'She just spoke a bit about the game today, she knew the crowd was going to be a big thing and we could control the game and win the game the way we wanted to, we did all those things and how proud she was of us. 'We started jumping up and celebrating she grabbed me and said 'stop jumping, you need to get ready for the next game, let the kids do it, you stand still'.' Australian fans were left crying into their beers as goals for England from Toone, Hemp and Alessia Russo sealed victory and put the Lionesses 90 minutes away from lifting two major trophies in just under 13 months. Second half strikes for the European champions from Russo and Hemp silenced the home crowd of 75,000 hostile fans amid a febrile atmosphere in Sydney, with Hemp's strike coming just minutes after Sam Kerr had equalised. England will now take on Spain for the trophy this Sunday at 11am UK time, after they beat Sweden 2-1 yesterday to book their trip to the final. The match comes just over a year after England won Euro 2022 by beating Germany and is England's first World Cup final since the men's famous triumph back in 1966. The Lionesses have clearly captured the hearts and minds of a nation once again, as all three Boxpark fan zones in London sold out eight minutes after the final whistle. A Boxpark spokesperson said that 2,500 tickets across their sites in Shoreditch, Wembley and Croydon sold out in under 10 minutes. A fan zone at Boxpark Croydon turned into an impromptu dance floor on Wednesday as the Lionesses confirmed their place in the final, knocking out the host nation. The only person who seemed to be sitting down when the final whistle was heard at the south London venue was a lone Australian at the front of the zone. Lionesses fans put children on their shoulders, danced on tables and sang football hits following the historic victory. Alison Symonds-Tayler, 65, watched England make the final at Boxpark Croydon. Draped in a Union flag and wearing a matching bow, the south Londoner said: 'We deserved to win. I think we dominated throughout the match and it was very exciting. 'I just think the girls did really well. Both teams did really well. There was a fantastic atmosphere. Boxpark did a great job. 'I feel sorry for the Matildas because I have Australian family but I think the best team won today. I think it's great to have women's sport get the credit it deserves.' A young England fan who also watched the game at Boxpark Croydon said it would be 'amazing for all upcoming footballers' if the Lionesses win the World Cup. Emily Bowen, 15, who had painted a St George's flag on her face using red glitter, told PA: 'I was actually ecstatic when the full-time whistle went. The click of reality, we're through to a World Cup final. 'After Australia equalised it was a bit nervy they were going to come back but (the Lionesses) stayed strong... I'm buzzing. 'We went out to France for the 2019 World Cup and then all of the Euros games last year we were at. I try to follow them everywhere and anywhere.' When asked how she will react if England win the World Cup, the Kent resident added: 'I honestly don't know. Just seeing the growth from when they won the Euros, to see that carry on, if they win the World Cup it would be amazing for all upcoming footballers, inspiring all the younger girls.' Dani Beazley, 51, vowed to return to Boxpark Croydon to watch England hopefully win the World Cup this weekend. Ms Beazley, from Battersea in south-west London, said: 'I will definitely be back on Sunday. I'm with my daughter and my sister. The reaction in the whole place is unbelievable. The place erupted. It was just brilliant. 'It is a brilliant atmosphere. (The music) goes on for an hour later and everyone is still enjoying themselves and having a lovely time. We are going to stick around for a while. 'It's a great atmosphere and Sunday will just be amazing. It will be double this. I reckon England 2-0. Fingers crossed.' In today's semi-final, both sides had early chances, with a key flashpoint just seconds in as Australia got a free kick after England's Keira Walsh fouled Kerr. Then, Alex Greenwood was booked on ten minutes for fouling the Aussie forward. England opened the scoring in the 36th minute when the ball skipped past Hemp inside the area and fell at the feet of Toone, who gave Australia goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold no chance with a strike into the top right corner. The Lionesses held a 1-0 lead at half-time, while millions of England fans watched on TV back home - with some taking a few hours off work to go to a pub or having it on the"}

William and Kate were seen holidaying on the Caribbean island of Mustique with the Middleton family, or off on a couple\'s ski trip in the Alps. While for many their jet-setting lifestyle looked dreamlike, it did not impress the late Queen who apparently expressed concern about the number of holidays her future granddaughter-in-law was taking every year. Perhaps aware that William and Kate would soon be engaged, the Queen stressed that the future Princess should get a job rather hoping around from country to country. The stern words of advice were said to have \'stung\' Kate, Royal expert Katie Nicholl has suggested. She wrote in her 2010 book William and Harry: \'If she was not with William at Balmoral then the couple were skiing or holidaying on Mustique. \'Kate was there so often the press dubbed her "Queen of Mustique", a title that had previously belonged to Princess Margaret\'. Princess Margaret\'s beautiful ten acre manor of Les Jolies Eaux, or Beautiful Waters, became her hideaway from the world\'s scrutiny after her marriage to the late Lord Snowdon imploded. She later said it was the only place where she could \'truly relax\'. When Kate was heading to the island in the 2000s, Britain was heading into a recession, and \'such frivolous displays of wealth were unpalatable to the Queen\', according to Nicholls. She added: \'While the rest of the world speculated that an engagement was on the horizon for William and Kate, the Queen believed an announcement should be postponed until Kate was settled in a career.\' One source quoted in the book added: \'It is Her Majesty\'s opinion that if Kate is one day going to be William\'s consort, then she needs a proper job. \'Swanning from one five-star holiday resort to another is not the prerequisite for a young woman possibly destined to be Queen.\' It is clear that the royal couple, since marrying and having their three children, have taken the Queen\'s advice to heart. While they have been seen holidaying on the Caribbean island since, they have also taken more staycations, including trips to their Norfolk, the Isle of Scilly and Balmoral. The family will also avoid overseas trips with their young children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, seven, and Prince Louis, according to OK! Magazine. Instead, they will holiday at their Norfolk royal residence, Amner Hall, instead of jetting off each summer. The royal expert told the magazine: \'Summer holidays at Anmer are the perfect way for Kate and William to decompress. \'If there are royal engagements for them, they\'ll be few and far between. \'While in the past we\'ve seen the couple enjoy more lavish holidays skiing or visiting sunnier climates, they\'ve been adopting a more traditional royal approach and spending their time at royal residences in the UK instead. \'This could obviously be the result of Covid travel restrictions, but I also believe that Kate and William are transforming into the future King and Queen and therefore are adopting more traditional practices.\''}

The Retail Sector Council, which is made up of members including the bosses of Boots, Sainsbury's and Primark, told ministers that competition law needed to be reformed to support the industry. Former Co-op chief Richard Pennycook, who is co-chairman of the council, said towns across the country risked becoming 'wastelands' because of the demise of high streets. He said: 'If we don't incentivise regeneration, then these places are getting hollowed out. 'What are we collectively going to do about that? The last five years in Chester, Northampton, pretty much any large town in the UK, this has been going on.' A Marks & Spencer executive also warned that crime rates on Oxford Street are surging as London's famous shopping district falls into disrepair. Sacha Berendji, the chain's operations director, said the area had once been 'the jewel in London's shopping crown' but was now little more than 'empty shops, littered streets and fewer visitors'. He said shocking scenes of social media-fuelled carnage this week as thugs attempted to loot stores were 'another reminder of how bad things are'. Mr Berendji told the Daily Telegraph: 'The street was practically locked down by police to prevent major unrest planned on social media. Londoners know that something must be done to save Oxford Street.' The chaos in central London echoes robberies and flashmob looting across the US in recent years, which has been organised through TikTok – while major cities such as San Francisco and New York are becoming crime-ravaged and drug-infested. It comes amid a battle to save Oxford Street, which is one of the biggest victims of the slow death of the high street across Britain. It has been overrun in recent years by tacky sweet shops that have replaced household names. Mr Berendji's comments come three weeks after M&S was refused permission to knock down and redevelop its Oxford Street store after opposition from Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove. Crowds gathered in Oxford Street last week after posts circulated on TikTok and Snapchat urging users to rob JD Sports. Nine people were arrested and Scotland Yard issued 34 dispersal orders, banning offenders from the area for 48 hours. Fears of violence then spread to Southend after troublemakers urged copycats to 'get lit' on the beach. Among those given a dispersal order by Essex Police officers yesterday was notorious TikTok prankster Mizzy, real name Bacari-Bronze O'Garro. The 18-year-old, who has been arrested on multiple occasions over pranks including invading people's homes, posted a video on social media of him being spoken to by a police officer in the sunshine outside the seafront's theme park Adventure Island. Oxford Street was once the flagship location for Britain's high-end stores but the shopping destination is becoming increasingly abandoned by the big-name brands that earned it such esteem. Photos taken by MailOnline revealed how Oxford Street has suffered and is now home to empty shells of ornate stonework stores that used to house some of the UK's most famous brands. The coronavirus pandemic has changed the look of the British high street for ever as iconic brands were plunged into administration and forced to close their doors. As big names such as TopShop, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Debenhams, Oasis and Warehouse disappeared, city centres across the country were left with empty windows and people instead searching for their favourite labels online. Despite this, shoppers continue to creep back, with footfall up 12 per cent year-on-year last week and seven per cent since the beginning of the year, according to New West End Company, which represents 600 retailers and hoteliers in the area. Britain's high streets were already in a state of decline as shoppers increasingly turned to online fast fashion. Yet the pandemic has been blamed for the eventual closures of popular shops. Big name brands have fled Oxford Street, leaving behind ghost stores in the once-iconic shopping destination. One of the most famous to go has been TopShop – which, just a decade ago, was the undisputed queen of the British high street. With its trendy clothes, sell-out designer collaborations and 100,000 sq ft Oxford Street flagship store, the brand attracted everyone from tourists and teenagers to It Girls and fashion editors. It is believed that aggressive competition from the likes of PrettyLittleThing, Boohoo and Missguided, which have lured Gen Z shoppers with their ultra fast fashion and even faster delivery times – perfect for a generation focused on showcasing style on social media – contributed to its demise. The burden of TopShop's 510 branches, including some 300 in the UK, was felt more keenly than ever as the Covid-19 pandemic led to a dramatic drop in footfall and a record number of shops closing during the first half of 2020. And its doors closed for ever after rescue plans to save the Arcadia group, owned by billionaire Sir Philip Green, failed and it entered administration in November 2021, making up to 2500 staff members redundant. Asos bought TopShop, alongside Topman and Miss Selfridge in April 2021 as part of a £330million deal to save the brands. The deal did not include the physical shops but you can still buy TopShop, Topman and Miss Selfridge clothes online on ASOS' website. Lisa Byfield-Green, Retail Week's data and insights director, said she expected more high street brands to go under due to the tough economic conditions. 'Investors are nervous right now in the difficult economic environment. Companies are also receiving no relief from rising business rates, which puts many high street businesses in danger,' she said. 'We expect to see the continuation of these difficulties into 2023. As the strain continues to mount, smaller and struggling retailers will be snapped up by larger brands (e.g. Next acquiring Made) or fall into administration. The market will diverge between success stories and those that cannot sustain the weight of"}

Hannah Ingram-Moore reportedly attended and judged awards ceremonies in 2021 and 2022 as interim chief executive of the Captain Tom Foundation, but had payments for the appearances made to her company, the Maytrix Group. The BBC claim thousands of pounds went into Maytrix after she attended the Virgin Media O2 Captain Tom Foundation Connector Awards – despite promotional videos suggesting she was representing the charity. In a firm email responding to the broadcaster's report, Ms Ingram-Moore initially said: 'You are awful. It's a total lie'. Six minutes later, however, she scrambled together a response telling the BBC: 'Apologies. That reply was for a scammer who has been creating havoc'. The Virgin Media event was named after the charity and had the charity logo on its award plaques. She is thought to have been on a salary of £85,000 as the charity's interim chief executive at the time. Ms Ingram-Moore, who owns Maytrix with her husband Colin, has not responded to the claims. Over the last year the Charity Commission has been investigating the Captain Tom Foundation for potential conflicts of interest. Her father, Sir Captain Tom Moore, made headlines during the pandemic for raising £38million for the NHS on sponsored laps of his garden. Ms Ingram-Moore did not seek approval from the Foundation's board before making her own commercial agreement with Virgin Media O2, BBC Newsnight reported last night. As a result an internal investigation was begun in November last year. She has not replied to questions from BBC Newsnight. The Charity Commission said its inquiry 'includes examining whether the trustees have adequately managed conflicts of interest, including with private companies connected to the Ingram-Moore family'. A Virgin Media spokesperson said: 'We worked directly with the late Sir Captain Tom to recognise community groups and charities that went above and beyond during the Covid-19 pandemic. 'When payment was made, we were not aware of any concerns about Ms Ingram-Moores family companies or the Captain Tom Foundation that have since come to light after our campaign and relationship with Captain Tom finished.' Virgin Media said they started working with Captain Tom directly during the lockdown, prior to the concerns raised about governance at either the Foundation or Ingram-Moores' companies. The Charity Commission has now been investigating possible conflicts of interest between Ingram-Moores' private companies and the charity for over a year. Captain Tom Moore raised money for the NHS Charities Together prior to the creation of the Captain Tom Foundation. He raised £38mn for the NHS Charities Together via a Just Giving page, sponsored for walking circuits of his garden during the lockdowns in 2020. The money raised in this way was donated directly to NHS Charities Together via the Just Giving page, and the Charity Commission has confirmed this money is not part of its investigation. The Captain Tom Foundation was set up in June 2020 with its declared aim to be recognising and raising money for organisations supporting the elderly in the UK. A spokesperson for NHS Charities Together said: 'The Captain Tom Foundation is a separate organisation that was established after Captain Tom raised funds for our Covid-19 Urgent Appeal, and the Charity Commission has made clear that the £38 million he raised for NHS Charities Together is not part of their investigation. 'In total our appeal raised over £160 million thanks to generous donations from thousands of supporters. 'This money has been distributed across the network of NHS charities to reach every NHS Trust and Health Board in the UK – funding thousands of projects providing vital mental health support for NHS staff, training for emergency volunteers, equipment and support for patients, and community partnership programmes to prevent ill health and reduce pressure on NHS services. 'The support we continue to provide has never been more important, and we are thankful to everyone who helps make it possible. 'A Covid appeal Progress Report demonstrates the difference donations are making and is available on our website.' A formal inquiry was later opened amid claims of potential mismanagement and misconduct between the separate Foundation and the Ingram-Moore's own companies. The Charity Commission has looked into decisions that may have 'generated significant profit' for Ingram-Moore and her partner by trademarking the Captain Tom brand without objection from the charity. Last month, the Captain Tom Foundation was also forced to clarify it was 'not under investigation' amid questions around an allegedly illegal extension to Ingram-Moore's £1.2mn Bedfordshire home. Foundation bosses halted the acceptance of donations as planning chiefs ordered that the annexe be razed. Ingram-Moore is no longer running the charity, but her husband remains a trustee. She and her husband are still directors of the Maytrix Group and Club Nook, which found itself at the centre of an inquiry around trademarked products. The Charity Commission last year explored concerns Club Nook 'may have generated significant profit' by trademarking the 'Captain Tom' brand without any objection from the charity. It has also investigated allegations of mismanagement and misconduct, and potential conflicts of interest between the foundation and companies set up by the late Second World War veteran's family. MailOnline has contacted Ms Ingram-Moore for a comment."}

Inspector Nicholas Mantle, of Dorset Police, was part of a WhatsApp group which was found to have shared sexual, pornographic, racist, homophobic, bullying and misogynistic messages. A misconduct hearing held in June found that he posted two offensive images in the WhatsApp chat and did not leave the group. While Mantle was not found to be the main instigator of the 'alpha male' offensive behaviour he failed to challenge a culture of bullying by the group of four other police officers that he supervised. He was found guilty of gross misconduct by the hearing panel who decided on Tuesday that he should be dismissed without notice. Mantle will now be placed on the barred list, meaning he cannot be employed in policing again. The four other officers involved in the WhatsApp group have already been dealt with. PC Mark Jordan-Gill and former officer Paul Perdrisat, who resigned before the misconduct hearing, were also found guilty of gross misconduct and placed on the barred list. PC Michael Lowther, who challenged the behaviour and left the WhatsApp group, and PC Matthew Young, who didn't challenge the group but had very limited participation, were found guilty of misconduct and handed a written warning and a final written warning respectively. The men were all serving as part of the Force Support Group between 2018 and 2021, when 'alpha male' Perdrisat bullied officers he saw as the weak link and created a 'toxic atmosphere'. He was also a major contributor to the WhatsApp group 'The Real FSG' where hundreds of offensive messages and images were shared. Following the conclusion of the final hearing in respect of Mantle, Temporary Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Farrell, Dorset Police's lead for professional standards, said the inspector encouraged the actions of his colleagues. She said: 'Inspector Nicholas Mantle was in a trusted supervisory role when he breached the Standards of Professional Behaviour by not only failing to challenge the derogatory and biased actions of colleagues within the team but also encouraged it by posting two offensive images to the group. 'His lack of action in failing to challenge this behaviour and failing to act when PC Lowther called it out is completely unacceptable. 'This is not the type of leader we wish to have in our force and as this case has shown we will robustly investigate offences and, if appropriate, remove individuals from the organisation. 'The public quite rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour from serving police officers and staff as this is a core component of maintaining the trust of our communities. 'I know the actions of these officers will have let our communities down. 'It is important to remind the public that this behaviour is not indicative of the overwhelming majority of our staff and teams out delivering quality policing every day to protect people and make Dorset a safe county for everyone. 'We are committed to driving up standards of behaviour within Dorset and ongoing work includes adopting learning across the organisation from this case to stamp out such behaviour, delivering inclusion training to officers and staff, and ensuring our vetting and enhanced vetting obligations are being met and fit for purpose.'"}

ENGLAND SCORE THEIR 3rd GOAL AGAINT AUSTRALIA!! ⚽️⚽️⚽️ #wwc2023 #lionesses pic.twitter.com/2NrYcKlsSX Reaction of England Fans at BOXPARK Wembley 3/ pic.twitter.com/f7ZMyXKUvz Ella Toone\'s stunning strike was followed up by cool finishes from Lauren Hemp and Alessia Russo for England to see off co-hosts Australia with a hard-fought 3-1 win. And the countdown has now begun before Sunday\'s final against Spain, who like England, are in the Women\'s World Cup final for the first time in their history. While it was joy for England, Australia were left heartbroken. Many supporters of the co-hosts at the match in Sydney were in tears as the Matildas crashed out. Back at home, England fans were toasting success in pubs up and down the country. There was chaos at BOXPARK Wembley as supporters, many in face paint, erupted over early morning pints. Many were draped in St George\'s flags as they went wild as the Lionesses did them proud - and even better, got one over the Aussies. England hero Gary Lineker took to Twitter to praise the Lionesses, tweeting: "Well played @Lionesses. Absolutely superb performance. A World Cup final. BETTING SPECIAL - BEST NO DEPOSIT CASINO OFFERS "A World Cup final at football. It’s been a while. What a wonderful achievement. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻." SunSport columnist Piers Morgan joked it was revenge for the summer\'s controversial Ashes series, writing: "England’s fabulous @Lionesses crush Australia’s wilting Matildas 3-1 in their own back yard to reach the Women’s World Cup Final… "Sweet revenge for the Jonny Bairstow Ashes runout debacle. "Congrats ladies- you’ve made your country proud! 👏👏👏." England defender Lucy Bronze declared it was a dream come true for her and her team-mates. Speaking to the BBC, she said: "The one thing I\'ve always wanted to do is get to a World Cup final. "After two times of such disappointment, I can\'t believe it. "We played how we wanted to, we were determined, resilient. We knew the crowd would be crazy and we talked about silencing them and at the end we did that. "We all dreamed of being in the final, all our family and friends have boked to stay here until then because they all believed in us. "It\'s been amazing to play against Australia, in Australia, what a fantastic tournament they had but we\'re in the final." Sarina Wiegman hailed her England team in an emotional interview with the BBC, saying: “The way we played… of course it was a hard game but we found a way to win. You’ve been talking about ruthlessness all the time, in this team there is ruthlessness. Whether it’s in attack or defence, we really want to keep the ball out of the net. “We stuck to the plan. I think [Australia have] done an incredible job. They really grew into the tournament. They’ve had some setbacks too… they had to win the last game in the group stage. As a team they are really tough to play against. Yeah, what a performance. "[On reaching a second World Cup final]. I don’t know. I just said… am I in a little fairytale or something?" Injury-stricken Lioness Beth Mead praised her team-mates as she said: "WORLD CUP FINAL BABBYY, GET IN @Lionesses 🥳🥳🥳." Despite huge injuries to Mead, Leah Williamson and Fran Kirby impacting the squad before the tournament, the brave Lionesses have overcome each obstacle they have faced so far. England kicked off their tournament with a stuttering 1-0 win over Haiti, before felling Denmark with the same score six days later. A Lauren James-inspired England then roared into life as they thrashed China 6-1 in their final group stage match. However, it was James who soon became the pantomime villain after her needless red card against Nigeria in the Last 16. Penalties followed after a goalless affair. But the Lionesses held their nerve, with Chloe Kelly\'s rocket of a penalty seeing us through to the quarter-finals, where our the side - captained by Millie Bright - faced off with Colombia. Once again the opponent proved to be tough, with the South Americans taking the lead shortly before half-time. But a last-gasp first-half equaliser from Hemp sent England into the interval level before Russo netted the decisive winner as England marched into the semi-final. The Matildas, bolstered by a returning Sam Kerr, would prove to be the biggest hurdle of all. Toone\'s first half strike was cancelled out by a Kerr stunner in the 63rd minute. However, Hemp fired the Lionesses back in front eight minutes later, shoving off her marker before slotting her shot into the bottom corner. The Women\'s Super Leagues first million pound star Russo then sealed the deal with her tidy finish into the bottom corner in the 86th minute. With the win England\'s Lionesses have made history by reaching their first World Cup final. And we\'re all desperate for them to repeat their trick of winning the Euros last year.'}

The star driver made a healthy £7million profit after selling the rare supercar for £8.5m last year. The 36-year-old purchased the vehicle for £1.6m with the motor specifically made for the seven-time Formula One world champion. But yesterday it was pictured severely damaged after a crash in the Penmaenbach Tunnel on the A55 expressway in Conwy, North Wales. Ethan Gale, a supercar photographer posted pictures of the damage on Instagram and wrote: "Very sad day in the motoring world this evening. "A car I never thought I would see. "Ever since seeing this on YouTube driving around Monaco back in the day, it’s always been a dream car to tick off the list. "Late this afternoon this Pagani Zonda 760 LH previously owned by Lewis Hamilton had crashed in the Penmaenbach tunnel, Conwy, North wales. "Hopefully the car gets a full restoration and is back on the road in the future." The one-off car, which boasts a purple exterior, was personally ordered from Horacio Pagani by Hamilton seven years ago. The Zonda 760 LH is capable of reaching 217mph, and can go from 0-60mph in less than three seconds. Hamilton once famously crashed the whip into three parked cars in 2015 in Monte Carlo ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix. He revealed that the accident was a result of heavy partying and a lack of sleep that caused him to lose control. The Arsenal fan remarked: "It was a result of heavy partying and not much rest for a week and a half. "I am a bit run down. I have been non-stop and trying to fit training in at the same time and not getting a lot of sleep.”'}

Katie Loxton, 27, embarked on a relationship with 32-year-old Adam Higgs while working at HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire. The couple spoke on the phone for more than 380 hours in 3,451 different calls during their six-month tryst. Higgs also used the contraband phone to message Loxton on social media. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the pair would often "perform sexual acts to each other" during the calls. Loxton has now been jailed for 12 months for misconduct in a public office. Higgs was handed an eight-month sentence for possessing inside a prison a device capable of transmitting or receiving images, sounds or information by electronic communications. The pair also admitted transmitting or causing the transmission of an image/sound by electronic means from within a prison. The court was told Loxton was arrested on January 27 last year.

While mating season usually begins in early September, when the little beasties search for somewhere to live over the winter, our cooler summer means many are beginning their hunt early. Male spiders often come into houses in search of females that have remained lurking indoors in places such as bathrooms and kitchen cabinets. Here, we look at what these giant spiders are, and pest controller Stuart Halliday gives his tips on how to get rid of them for good. Many different spider species will invade our homes this autumn, but the giant house spider is the one you will see most often. They live in sheds, attics, homes and out-buildings and can survive for several months without any food or water. They can have leg spans of up to 12cm and are seen all year round but mate in the autumn time. Entomologist Brian Eversham told ITV news there is a simple explanation for why they appear so big - that they grow during the spring and pop up this time of year as adults. "This happens every year - during the spring time they are often quite small, and come late summer and adult, the spiders are adults," he said. "They are fast moving, so they are the ones that people tend to notice. The females, quite sensibly, sit quietly in a corner of a room in their web, catching insects. People almost never notice that they\'ve got female house spiders, tucked away in a shaded corner. "The males go walking around, looking for the females, and that\'s when people tend to notice them. People think that there are suddenly a lot more, but it\'s just that they have started behaving differently." Although, this spider is called the \'giant\' spider, it\'s not the biggest in the UK. The cardinal spider is the largest spider across the British isles. Otherwise known as Tegenaria parietina, some of these spiders have been recorded to have a leg span of 12cm. It normally lives for two or three years, but lifetimes of up to six years have been observed. While the female only leaves its nest to feed, males can often be seen wandering around houses during the late summer and early autumn looking for a mate. This so-called "spider season" normally begins in the first two weeks of September and ends by the first week of October. Keeping your house clean is the most effective way to deter spiders. Dust and vacuum any spider webs or egg sacs (which will be ball shaped, and often hidden in the web) waiting to hatch. Spiders will be less eager to return when their offspring and habitats have been removed. If you do this as soon as you spot them, it will make cleaning a whole lot easier. Top of the list and perhaps the easiest (and most fragrant) is to use peppermint oil to deter our eight-legged friends. After cleaning your home, you can mix up a two-part solution by adding around 20 drops of peppermint oil to a bottle of water. Simply pour this into a spray bottle and spritz all around your house. Bottles of peppermint oil cost as little as £2 online for 10ml. And the good news is that with 20 drops equating to around 1ml, you can whip up a handy homemade spray for just 20p. Citrus and eucalyptus are also good alternatives. You can peel lemons and oranges and leave the peel in places where spiders might like to hide to put them off, but replace it regularly as the aroma won’t last forever. Another simple way to stop the crawlies getting in is to seal up any cracks around your doors and windows, according to pest control expert Stuart Halliday. "Sometimes if you have your windows changed, or if you live in an older property, there can be gaps both on the inside and outside meaning spiders and other insects can get in," he said. "You should make sure these are sealed up and then to help keep the spiders out put lemongrass cleaners or oil around windows and doors as they don\'t like the smell. "Also growing basil, thyme and rosemary on windowsills will keep the pests out and deter wasps, woodlice and other small crawlies."'}
