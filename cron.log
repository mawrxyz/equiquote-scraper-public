The inflation rate, measuring price changes over time, fell to 6.8% in the year to July, down from 7.9% in June. Lower electricity and gas prices drove the drop, but price rises in other areas have led to expectations that interest rates will be raised further. The cost of eating out has risen, along with alcohol and tobacco prices. Flight prices continued to rise, jumping almost 30% compared to July last year, according to the official figures, released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Inflation is much lower than it was at its peak of 11.1% in October, but it still remains high compared to historical rates and much higher than the Bank of England\'s 2% target. When the rate of inflation falls, it does not mean that prices are coming down, but that they are rising less quickly. Wages have been failing to keep up with rising prices for some time, but there are potential signs of change after figures on Tuesday revealed wages rose 7.8% annually between April and June. Alongside reductions in energy bills, price rises for staple food items like milk, butter, bread, eggs, cereal and fish eased. But overall, food still costs almost 15% more than one year ago. Matthew Corder, deputy director of prices at the ONS, said falling gas and electricity prices drove down inflation last month when a change to the energy price cap, which limits how much suppliers can charge households for what they use, came into force. While easing energy bills and food costs will be welcome for households, there "will be little cause for celebration" at the Bank of England, according to Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. "Inflation is still significantly above that 2% target and even if it is cooling off faster than a sunburnt Brit diving into a hotel pool, prices are not falling, they\'re just not rising as fast as they have been," she said. "Wage increases and price pressures have forced up service costs and that\'s weaving its own nasty spell on core inflation," she added. Core inflation, which strips out the price of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, remained unchanged in July at 6.9%. The rate is higher than in Germany, France, and the US and it is a figure that is closely watched by the Bank of England, which sets interest rates. With inflation still more than three times the Bank\'s 2% target, many experts expect it will raise interest rates again in September in an attempt to slow price rises. The Bank has steadily increased interest rates to 5.25%, the highest level in 15 years, meaning mortgage costs have jumped, but savings rates have also increased. Higher rates can also lead to high credit card and loan repayments. It hopes that if it makes borrowing more expensive, people will spend less, demand will slow, and prices will not rise as quickly. Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said with wage growth and services inflation both stronger than the Bank had expected, its decision makers would look to raise rates from 5.25% to 5.5% in September. In the year to July, services inflation, which includes data on prices for services in venues like bars, hairdressers and restaurants was back up to 7.4%, the joint highest level since 1992. The ONS said price increases for hotels drove services inflation higher. At first glance, this sharp fall in the rate of inflation to below 7% puts the UK on a path to a more "normal" economic situation. However, the underlying measures of inflationary pressures across the economy, are no longer going in the right direction. Services inflation was back up to 7.4% - the joint highest level since 1992. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, remained at 6.9%. The significance of these measures is that they show how much inflation is left in the economy, after the direct impacts of the energy shock have passed through. This set of figures increase the likelihood of further interest rate rises in September and perhaps October too. While the prime minister has said there is "light at the end of the tunnel", Wednesday\'s figures confirm that we can see a tunnel out of this, but it may still be some time before the light is reached.

Feyisara, who runs the business with his wife, said a box of plantain costs between £35 and £40 compared to £16 five years ago, while prices for meat and beans and other imported ingredients have risen. He said he is fortunate to be on a busy street market with steady footfall, but fears if wholesale costs do not ease soon, the shop will have to put up its prices. "Everything\'s gone up but somehow we\'ve been able to absorb it," he said. "If they don\'t fall, we\'ll have to unfortunately increase our prices. So that the business can cope." Prime Minister Rishi Sunak defended his record on tackling the cost of living, saying the plan to ease rising prices was working. He said it was difficult for people to understand the scale of government support with energy bills. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said inflation in Britain remained "higher than many other major economies". "After 13 years of economic chaos and incompetence under the Conservatives, working people are worse off - with higher energy bills and prices in the shops," she said. Heidi Karjalainen, a research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested the government\'s pledge to halve inflation by the end of this year was "always a little odd as there is only so much the Treasury'}

With fewer properties available to rent in many areas, the mismatch between supply and demand has pushed up costs for many people. Prices paid by UK renters rose by 5.3% on average in the year to July, the Office for National Statistics said. The figures come as rising prices continues to squeeze household budgets. The inflation rate, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, fell to 6.8% in the year to July. Although this was down from 7.9% in June, it is still far above the Bank of England\'s target of 2%. High demand from tenants at the same time as landlords reducing the number of available properties is one of the key reasons behind the rent increase. Competition among renters is so intense that there are 20 requests to view each available property, according to recent figures commissioned by the BBC from property portal Rightmove, up from six in pre-pandemic 2019. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows UK average annual rent increases accelerated to 5.3% from 5.2% the previous month. There was a 5.5% increase in rents in London, which was the only region where house prices had fallen. This was the sharpest increase in rent since comparable records began for London in 2006. The same annual rent rise was recorded in the West Midlands as well as Yorkshire and the Humber. There were even bigger rises for tenants in Wales, where the average was up 6.5% in a year, and in Scotland (up 5.7%). In Northern Ireland, where the data is collected slightly differently, there was a 9.2% increase in the year to May, although this was lower than a previous peak. Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at estate agency Knight Frank, said: "The squeeze on tenants will not end any time soon." He said that there was more financial pain for tenants as the supply of rental property fell and rents rose. "It is an imbalance compounded by the fact landlords now face higher mortgage rates," he added. Official data on wages and inflation have led analysts to suggest that there could be further rises in the Bank of England\'s benchmark rate, which would mean ongoing pressure on landlords and homeowners through relatively high mortgage rates. Average UK house prices increased by 1.7% annually, down from a revised 1.8% rise in May, the ONS said, as the market cools as a result of the mortgage rate hikes.

Sara's body was found at her home in Woking, Surrey, on 10 August. The BBC has spoken to a travel agent in the town who said he was contacted by someone known to Sara, wanting tickets for three adults and five children. Police want to speak to three people known to Sara - who they have not named - and who left the UK on 9 August. Surrey Police launched a murder investigation after Sara's body was found alone in the family home 02:50 BST. Speaking to the BBC, the travel agent in Woking identified the person making the booking on the evening of 8 August to travel the following day, whom he said had used his services before. The BBC has spoken to police in Pakistan who have said that no formal approach has been made by the British authorities over the case. Pakistan and the UK do not have a formal extradition treaty. In an interview with the Sun newspaper Sara's mother spoke about her grief and disbelief that her daughter was dead. Olga Sharif was divorced from Sara's father, who had custody of the child. A post-mortem examination was due to be carried out yesterday (Tuesday) on the 10-year-old but a cause of death has not been formally confirmed."}

The prime minister said halving inflation was a top priority and his plan to ease rising prices was working. It comes as the latest figures showed inflation slowed last month due to lower energy costs. But food, restaurants and hotel costs are still rising. The inflation rate, which measures price changes over time, fell to 6.8% in the year to July, down from 7.9% in June. This means prices are rising less quickly. Inflation is much lower than it was at its peak of 11.1% in October, but it still remains high compared to historical rates and much higher than the Bank of England\'s 2% target. Speaking at a business event in Enderby, Leicestershire, Mr Sunak said that unlike furlough, where the government subsidised wages of employees hit by the Covid pandemic, "no one quite understands the scale of what we\'ve done" with energy bill support. "A typical family will have had about half their energy bills paid for by the government over past several months - that\'s worth £1,500 to a typical family," he said. "Now you wouldn\'t have quite seen that because you would have still just got your energy bill, it would have been very high and you\'d have been, \'Oh my gosh, what\'s going on\', but what you wouldn\'t have realised, maybe, is that before that even happened, £1,500 had been lopped off, and the government had covered it." Under the Energy Price Guarantee, the government limited energy bills for a typical household to £2,500 a year, alongside a £400 winter discount. However, the guarantee ended in July. The Liberal Democrats described Mr Sunak\'s comments as "woefully out of touch". The party\'s Cabinet Office spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: "Does he expect the public to give the Conservative Party a pat on the back for crashing the economy and adding hundreds of pounds a month to people\'s mortgages? "He just does not get it." Mr Sunak said his plan to halve inflation, by being "responsible" with spending and borrowing, was working. However, speaking to journalists at the same event, he said he was "not complacent" and knew "things are tough right now". The prime minister added that the government was also helping people by cutting fuel duty, capping bus fares outside London, and giving support payments to pensioners and people on Universal Credit. Labour\'s deputy leader Angela Rayner said the fall in inflation was a "relief" but prices were still going up, just at a lower rate. She blamed the Conservatives for "a decade of low growth, low pay and high taxes".'}

Jubilant Lionesses celebrate reaching first World Cup final with 3-1 win over Australia by dancing to Sweet Caroline in their dressing room - before Sarina Wiegman tells them to save their energy for the next game', 'byline': 'TOM PYMAN', 'time': '2023-08-16T15:38:08+0100', 'text': "The Lionesses celebrated reaching their maiden World Cup final, and England's first in nearly 60 years, by dancing to Sweet Caroline today - but there were only soft drinks in sight with one more step to go on the road to glory. The team's official Twitter account posted three images from behind the scenes in Sydney, following an historic 3-1 win over old rivals, Australia. It was captioned 'Good times never seemed so good!' - lyrics from the Neil Diamond classic which has become something of a celebratory anthem for England in recent tournaments. Goalscorers Lauren Hemp and Ella Toone led the jubilant scenes Down Under - but focus was clearly already turning to Sunday's final with Spain, as the players were pictured with cans of Fanta and Coke, rather than champagne. Boss Sarina Wiegman was clearly keen to keep a lid on celebrations, even telling defender Lucy Bronze to 'stop jumping' and to immediately begin preparations for Sunday's showpiece final. Reflecting on her coach's speech after the game, Bronze said: 'She just spoke a bit about the game today, she knew the crowd was going to be a big thing and we could control the game and win the game the way we wanted to, we did all those things and how proud she was of us. 'We started jumping up and celebrating she grabbed me and said 'stop jumping, you need to get ready for the next game, let the kids do it, you stand still'.' Australian fans were left crying into their beers as goals for England from Toone, Hemp and Alessia Russo sealed victory and put the Lionesses 90 minutes away from lifting two major trophies in just under 13 months. Second half strikes for the European champions from Russo and Hemp silenced the home crowd of 75,000 hostile fans amid a febrile atmosphere in Sydney, with Hemp's strike coming just minutes after Sam Kerr had equalised. England will now take on Spain for the trophy this Sunday at 11am UK time, after they beat Sweden 2-1 yesterday to book their trip to the final. The match comes just over a year after England won Euro 2022 by beating Germany and is England's first World Cup final since the men's famous triumph back in 1966. The Lionesses have clearly captured the hearts and minds of a nation once again, as all three Boxpark fan zones in London sold out eight minutes after the final whistle. A Boxpark spokesperson said that 2,500 tickets across their sites in Shoreditch, Wembley and Croydon sold out in under 10 minutes. A fan zone at Boxpark Croydon turned into an impromptu dance floor on Wednesday as the Lionesses confirmed their place in the final, knocking out the host nation. The only person who seemed to be sitting down when the final whistle was heard at the south London venue was a lone Australian at the front of the zone. Lionesses fans put children on their shoulders, danced on tables and sang football hits following the historic victory. Alison Symonds-Tayler, 65, watched England make the final at Boxpark Croydon. Draped in a Union flag and wearing a matching bow, the south Londoner said: 'We deserved to win. I think we dominated throughout the match and it was very exciting. 'I just think the girls did really well. Both teams did really well. There was a fantastic atmosphere. Boxpark did a great job. 'I feel sorry for the Matildas because I have Australian family but I think the best team won today. I think it's great to have women's sport get the credit it deserves.' A young England fan who also watched the game at Boxpark Croydon said it would be 'amazing for all upcoming footballers' if the Lionesses win the World Cup. Emily Bowen, 15, who had painted a St George's flag on her face using red glitter, told PA: 'I was actually ecstatic when the full-time whistle went. The click of reality, we're through to a World Cup final. 'After Australia equalised it was a bit nervy they were going to come back but (the Lionesses) stayed strong... I'm buzzing. 'We went out to France for the 2019 World Cup and then all of the Euros games last year we were at. I try to follow them everywhere and anywhere.' When asked how she will react if England win the World Cup, the Kent resident added: 'I honestly don't know. Just seeing the growth from when they won the Euros, to see that carry on, if they win the World Cup it would be amazing for all upcoming footballers, inspiring all the younger girls.' Dani Beazley, 51, vowed to return to Boxpark Croydon to watch England hopefully win the World Cup this weekend. Ms Beazley, from Battersea in south-west London, said: 'I will definitely be back on Sunday. I'm with my daughter and my sister. The reaction in the whole place is unbelievable. The place erupted. It was just brilliant. 'It is a brilliant atmosphere. (The music) goes on for an hour later and everyone is still enjoying themselves and having a lovely time. We are going to stick around for a while. 'It's a great atmosphere and Sunday will just be amazing. It will be double this. I reckon England 2-0. Fingers crossed.' In today's semi-final, both sides had early chances, with a key flashpoint just seconds in as Australia got a free kick after England's Keira Walsh fouled Kerr. Then, Alex Greenwood was booked on ten minutes for fouling the Aussie forward. England opened the scoring in the 36th minute when the ball skipped past Hemp inside the area and fell at the feet of Toone, who gave Australia goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold no chance with a strike into the top right corner. The Lionesses held a 1-0 lead at half-time, while millions of England fans watched on TV back home - with some taking a few hours off work to go to a pub or having it on the"}

William and Kate were seen holidaying on the Caribbean island of Mustique with the Middleton family, or off on a couple\'s ski trip in the Alps. While for many their jet-setting lifestyle looked dreamlike, it did not impress the late Queen who apparently expressed concern about the number of holidays her future granddaughter-in-law was taking every year. Perhaps aware that William and Kate would soon be engaged, the Queen stressed that the future Princess should get a job rather hoping around from country to country. The stern words of advice were said to have \'stung\' Kate, Royal expert Katie Nicholl has suggested. She wrote in her 2010 book William and Harry: \'If she was not with William at Balmoral then the couple were skiing or holidaying on Mustique. \'Kate was there so often the press dubbed her "Queen of Mustique", a title that had previously belonged to Princess Margaret\'. Princess Margaret\'s beautiful ten acre manor of Les Jolies Eaux, or Beautiful Waters, became her hideaway from the world\'s scrutiny after her marriage to the late Lord Snowdon imploded. She later said it was the only place where she could \'truly relax\'. When Kate was heading to the island in the 2000s, Britain was heading into a recession, and \'such frivolous displays of wealth were unpalatable to the Queen\', according to Nicholls. She added: \'While the rest of the world speculated that an engagement was on the horizon for William and Kate, the Queen believed an announcement should be postponed until Kate was settled in a career.\' One source quoted in the book added: \'It is Her Majesty\'s opinion that if Kate is one day going to be William\'s consort, then she needs a proper job. \'Swanning from one five-star holiday resort to another is not the prerequisite for a young woman possibly destined to be Queen.\' It is clear that the royal couple, since marrying and having their three children, have taken the Queen\'s advice to heart. While they have been seen holidaying on the Caribbean island since, they have also taken more staycations, including trips to their Norfolk, the Isle of Scilly and Balmoral. The family will also avoid overseas trips with their young children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, seven, and Prince Louis, according to OK! Magazine. Instead, they will holiday at their Norfolk royal residence, Amner Hall, instead of jetting off each summer. The royal expert told the magazine: \'Summer holidays at Anmer are the perfect way for Kate and William to decompress. \'If there are royal engagements for them, they\'ll be few and far between. \'While in the past we\'ve seen the couple enjoy more lavish holidays skiing or visiting sunnier climates, they\'ve been adopting a more traditional royal approach and spending their time at royal residences in the UK instead. \'This could obviously be the result of Covid travel restrictions, but I also believe that Kate and William are transforming into the future King and Queen and therefore are adopting more traditional practices.\''}

The Retail Sector Council, which is made up of members including the bosses of Boots, Sainsbury's and Primark, told ministers that competition law needed to be reformed to support the industry. Former Co-op chief Richard Pennycook, who is co-chairman of the council, said towns across the country risked becoming 'wastelands' because of the demise of high streets. He said: 'If we don't incentivise regeneration, then these places are getting hollowed out. 'What are we collectively going to do about that? The last five years in Chester, Northampton, pretty much any large town in the UK, this has been going on.' A Marks & Spencer executive also warned that crime rates on Oxford Street are surging as London's famous shopping district falls into disrepair. Sacha Berendji, the chain's operations director, said the area had once been 'the jewel in London's shopping crown' but was now little more than 'empty shops, littered streets and fewer visitors'. He said shocking scenes of social media-fuelled carnage this week as thugs attempted to loot stores were 'another reminder of how bad things are'. Mr Berendji told the Daily Telegraph: 'The street was practically locked down by police to prevent major unrest planned on social media. Londoners know that something must be done to save Oxford Street.' The chaos in central London echoes robberies and flashmob looting across the US in recent years, which has been organised through TikTok – while major cities such as San Francisco and New York are becoming crime-ravaged and drug-infested. It comes amid a battle to save Oxford Street, which is one of the biggest victims of the slow death of the high street across Britain. It has been overrun in recent years by tacky sweet shops that have replaced household names. Mr Berendji's comments come three weeks after M&S was refused permission to knock down and redevelop its Oxford Street store after opposition from Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove. Crowds gathered in Oxford Street last week after posts circulated on TikTok and Snapchat urging users to rob JD Sports. Nine people were arrested and Scotland Yard issued 34 dispersal orders, banning offenders from the area for 48 hours. Fears of violence then spread to Southend after troublemakers urged copycats to 'get lit' on the beach. Among those given a dispersal order by Essex Police officers yesterday was notorious TikTok prankster Mizzy, real name Bacari-Bronze O'Garro. The 18-year-old, who has been arrested on multiple occasions over pranks including invading people's homes, posted a video on social media of him being spoken to by a police officer in the sunshine outside the seafront's theme park Adventure Island. Oxford Street was once the flagship location for Britain's high-end stores but the shopping destination is becoming increasingly abandoned by the big-name brands that earned it such esteem. Photos taken by MailOnline revealed how Oxford Street has suffered and is now home to empty shells of ornate stonework stores that used to house some of the UK's most famous brands. The coronavirus pandemic has changed the look of the British high street for ever as iconic brands were plunged into administration and forced to close their doors. As big names such as TopShop, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Debenhams, Oasis and Warehouse disappeared, city centres across the country were left with empty windows and people instead searching for their favourite labels online. Despite this, shoppers continue to creep back, with footfall up 12 per cent year-on-year last week and seven per cent since the beginning of the year, according to New West End Company, which represents 600 retailers and hoteliers in the area. Britain's high streets were already in a state of decline as shoppers increasingly turned to online fast fashion. Yet the pandemic has been blamed for the eventual closures of popular shops. Big name brands have fled Oxford Street, leaving behind ghost stores in the once-iconic shopping destination. One of the most famous to go has been TopShop – which, just a decade ago, was the undisputed queen of the British high street. With its trendy clothes, sell-out designer collaborations and 100,000 sq ft Oxford Street flagship store, the brand attracted everyone from tourists and teenagers to It Girls and fashion editors. It is believed that aggressive competition from the likes of PrettyLittleThing, Boohoo and Missguided, which have lured Gen Z shoppers with their ultra fast fashion and even faster delivery times – perfect for a generation focused on showcasing style on social media – contributed to its demise. The burden of TopShop's 510 branches, including some 300 in the UK, was felt more keenly than ever as the Covid-19 pandemic led to a dramatic drop in footfall and a record number of shops closing during the first half of 2020. And its doors closed for ever after rescue plans to save the Arcadia group, owned by billionaire Sir Philip Green, failed and it entered administration in November 2021, making up to 2500 staff members redundant. Asos bought TopShop, alongside Topman and Miss Selfridge in April 2021 as part of a £330million deal to save the brands. The deal did not include the physical shops but you can still buy TopShop, Topman and Miss Selfridge clothes online on ASOS' website. Lisa Byfield-Green, Retail Week's data and insights director, said she expected more high street brands to go under due to the tough economic conditions. 'Investors are nervous right now in the difficult economic environment. Companies are also receiving no relief from rising business rates, which puts many high street businesses in danger,' she said. 'We expect to see the continuation of these difficulties into 2023. As the strain continues to mount, smaller and struggling retailers will be snapped up by larger brands (e.g. Next acquiring Made) or fall into administration. The market will diverge between success stories and those that cannot sustain the weight of"}

Hannah Ingram-Moore reportedly attended and judged awards ceremonies in 2021 and 2022 as interim chief executive of the Captain Tom Foundation, but had payments for the appearances made to her company, the Maytrix Group. The BBC claim thousands of pounds went into Maytrix after she attended the Virgin Media O2 Captain Tom Foundation Connector Awards – despite promotional videos suggesting she was representing the charity. In a firm email responding to the broadcaster's report, Ms Ingram-Moore initially said: 'You are awful. It's a total lie'. Six minutes later, however, she scrambled together a response telling the BBC: 'Apologies. That reply was for a scammer who has been creating havoc'. The Virgin Media event was named after the charity and had the charity logo on its award plaques. She is thought to have been on a salary of £85,000 as the charity's interim chief executive at the time. Ms Ingram-Moore, who owns Maytrix with her husband Colin, has not responded to the claims. Over the last year the Charity Commission has been investigating the Captain Tom Foundation for potential conflicts of interest. Her father, Sir Captain Tom Moore, made headlines during the pandemic for raising £38million for the NHS on sponsored laps of his garden. Ms Ingram-Moore did not seek approval from the Foundation's board before making her own commercial agreement with Virgin Media O2, BBC Newsnight reported last night. As a result an internal investigation was begun in November last year. She has not replied to questions from BBC Newsnight. The Charity Commission said its inquiry 'includes examining whether the trustees have adequately managed conflicts of interest, including with private companies connected to the Ingram-Moore family'. A Virgin Media spokesperson said: 'We worked directly with the late Sir Captain Tom to recognise community groups and charities that went above and beyond during the Covid-19 pandemic. 'When payment was made, we were not aware of any concerns about Ms Ingram-Moores family companies or the Captain Tom Foundation that have since come to light after our campaign and relationship with Captain Tom finished.' Virgin Media said they started working with Captain Tom directly during the lockdown, prior to the concerns raised about governance at either the Foundation or Ingram-Moores' companies. The Charity Commission has now been investigating possible conflicts of interest between Ingram-Moores' private companies and the charity for over a year. Captain Tom Moore raised money for the NHS Charities Together prior to the creation of the Captain Tom Foundation. He raised £38mn for the NHS Charities Together via a Just Giving page, sponsored for walking circuits of his garden during the lockdowns in 2020. The money raised in this way was donated directly to NHS Charities Together via the Just Giving page, and the Charity Commission has confirmed this money is not part of its investigation. The Captain Tom Foundation was set up in June 2020 with its declared aim to be recognising and raising money for organisations supporting the elderly in the UK. A spokesperson for NHS Charities Together said: 'The Captain Tom Foundation is a separate organisation that was established after Captain Tom raised funds for our Covid-19 Urgent Appeal, and the Charity Commission has made clear that the £38 million he raised for NHS Charities Together is not part of their investigation. 'In total our appeal raised over £160 million thanks to generous donations from thousands of supporters. 'This money has been distributed across the network of NHS charities to reach every NHS Trust and Health Board in the UK – funding thousands of projects providing vital mental health support for NHS staff, training for emergency volunteers, equipment and support for patients, and community partnership programmes to prevent ill health and reduce pressure on NHS services. 'The support we continue to provide has never been more important, and we are thankful to everyone who helps make it possible. 'A Covid appeal Progress Report demonstrates the difference donations are making and is available on our website.' A formal inquiry was later opened amid claims of potential mismanagement and misconduct between the separate Foundation and the Ingram-Moore's own companies. The Charity Commission has looked into decisions that may have 'generated significant profit' for Ingram-Moore and her partner by trademarking the Captain Tom brand without objection from the charity. Last month, the Captain Tom Foundation was also forced to clarify it was 'not under investigation' amid questions around an allegedly illegal extension to Ingram-Moore's £1.2mn Bedfordshire home. Foundation bosses halted the acceptance of donations as planning chiefs ordered that the annexe be razed. Ingram-Moore is no longer running the charity, but her husband remains a trustee. She and her husband are still directors of the Maytrix Group and Club Nook, which found itself at the centre of an inquiry around trademarked products. The Charity Commission last year explored concerns Club Nook 'may have generated significant profit' by trademarking the 'Captain Tom' brand without any objection from the charity. It has also investigated allegations of mismanagement and misconduct, and potential conflicts of interest between the foundation and companies set up by the late Second World War veteran's family. MailOnline has contacted Ms Ingram-Moore for a comment."}

Inspector Nicholas Mantle, of Dorset Police, was part of a WhatsApp group which was found to have shared sexual, pornographic, racist, homophobic, bullying and misogynistic messages. A misconduct hearing held in June found that he posted two offensive images in the WhatsApp chat and did not leave the group. While Mantle was not found to be the main instigator of the 'alpha male' offensive behaviour he failed to challenge a culture of bullying by the group of four other police officers that he supervised. He was found guilty of gross misconduct by the hearing panel who decided on Tuesday that he should be dismissed without notice. Mantle will now be placed on the barred list, meaning he cannot be employed in policing again. The four other officers involved in the WhatsApp group have already been dealt with. PC Mark Jordan-Gill and former officer Paul Perdrisat, who resigned before the misconduct hearing, were also found guilty of gross misconduct and placed on the barred list. PC Michael Lowther, who challenged the behaviour and left the WhatsApp group, and PC Matthew Young, who didn't challenge the group but had very limited participation, were found guilty of misconduct and handed a written warning and a final written warning respectively. The men were all serving as part of the Force Support Group between 2018 and 2021, when 'alpha male' Perdrisat bullied officers he saw as the weak link and created a 'toxic atmosphere'. He was also a major contributor to the WhatsApp group 'The Real FSG' where hundreds of offensive messages and images were shared. Following the conclusion of the final hearing in respect of Mantle, Temporary Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Farrell, Dorset Police's lead for professional standards, said the inspector encouraged the actions of his colleagues. She said: 'Inspector Nicholas Mantle was in a trusted supervisory role when he breached the Standards of Professional Behaviour by not only failing to challenge the derogatory and biased actions of colleagues within the team but also encouraged it by posting two offensive images to the group. 'His lack of action in failing to challenge this behaviour and failing to act when PC Lowther called it out is completely unacceptable. 'This is not the type of leader we wish to have in our force and as this case has shown we will robustly investigate offences and, if appropriate, remove individuals from the organisation. 'The public quite rightly expect the highest standards of behaviour from serving police officers and staff as this is a core component of maintaining the trust of our communities. 'I know the actions of these officers will have let our communities down. 'It is important to remind the public that this behaviour is not indicative of the overwhelming majority of our staff and teams out delivering quality policing every day to protect people and make Dorset a safe county for everyone. 'We are committed to driving up standards of behaviour within Dorset and ongoing work includes adopting learning across the organisation from this case to stamp out such behaviour, delivering inclusion training to officers and staff, and ensuring our vetting and enhanced vetting obligations are being met and fit for purpose.'"}

ENGLAND SCORE THEIR 3rd GOAL AGAINT AUSTRALIA!! ⚽️⚽️⚽️ #wwc2023 #lionesses pic.twitter.com/2NrYcKlsSX Reaction of England Fans at BOXPARK Wembley 3/ pic.twitter.com/f7ZMyXKUvz Ella Toone\'s stunning strike was followed up by cool finishes from Lauren Hemp and Alessia Russo for England to see off co-hosts Australia with a hard-fought 3-1 win. And the countdown has now begun before Sunday\'s final against Spain, who like England, are in the Women\'s World Cup final for the first time in their history. While it was joy for England, Australia were left heartbroken. Many supporters of the co-hosts at the match in Sydney were in tears as the Matildas crashed out. Back at home, England fans were toasting success in pubs up and down the country. There was chaos at BOXPARK Wembley as supporters, many in face paint, erupted over early morning pints. Many were draped in St George\'s flags as they went wild as the Lionesses did them proud - and even better, got one over the Aussies. England hero Gary Lineker took to Twitter to praise the Lionesses, tweeting: "Well played @Lionesses. Absolutely superb performance. A World Cup final. BETTING SPECIAL - BEST NO DEPOSIT CASINO OFFERS "A World Cup final at football. It’s been a while. What a wonderful achievement. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻." SunSport columnist Piers Morgan joked it was revenge for the summer\'s controversial Ashes series, writing: "England’s fabulous @Lionesses crush Australia’s wilting Matildas 3-1 in their own back yard to reach the Women’s World Cup Final… "Sweet revenge for the Jonny Bairstow Ashes runout debacle. "Congrats ladies- you’ve made your country proud! 👏👏👏." England defender Lucy Bronze declared it was a dream come true for her and her team-mates. Speaking to the BBC, she said: "The one thing I\'ve always wanted to do is get to a World Cup final. "After two times of such disappointment, I can\'t believe it. "We played how we wanted to, we were determined, resilient. We knew the crowd would be crazy and we talked about silencing them and at the end we did that. "We all dreamed of being in the final, all our family and friends have boked to stay here until then because they all believed in us. "It\'s been amazing to play against Australia, in Australia, what a fantastic tournament they had but we\'re in the final." Sarina Wiegman hailed her England team in an emotional interview with the BBC, saying: “The way we played… of course it was a hard game but we found a way to win. You’ve been talking about ruthlessness all the time, in this team there is ruthlessness. Whether it’s in attack or defence, we really want to keep the ball out of the net. “We stuck to the plan. I think [Australia have] done an incredible job. They really grew into the tournament. They’ve had some setbacks too… they had to win the last game in the group stage. As a team they are really tough to play against. Yeah, what a performance. "[On reaching a second World Cup final]. I don’t know. I just said… am I in a little fairytale or something?" Injury-stricken Lioness Beth Mead praised her team-mates as she said: "WORLD CUP FINAL BABBYY, GET IN @Lionesses 🥳🥳🥳." Despite huge injuries to Mead, Leah Williamson and Fran Kirby impacting the squad before the tournament, the brave Lionesses have overcome each obstacle they have faced so far. England kicked off their tournament with a stuttering 1-0 win over Haiti, before felling Denmark with the same score six days later. A Lauren James-inspired England then roared into life as they thrashed China 6-1 in their final group stage match. However, it was James who soon became the pantomime villain after her needless red card against Nigeria in the Last 16. Penalties followed after a goalless affair. But the Lionesses held their nerve, with Chloe Kelly\'s rocket of a penalty seeing us through to the quarter-finals, where our the side - captained by Millie Bright - faced off with Colombia. Once again the opponent proved to be tough, with the South Americans taking the lead shortly before half-time. But a last-gasp first-half equaliser from Hemp sent England into the interval level before Russo netted the decisive winner as England marched into the semi-final. The Matildas, bolstered by a returning Sam Kerr, would prove to be the biggest hurdle of all. Toone\'s first half strike was cancelled out by a Kerr stunner in the 63rd minute. However, Hemp fired the Lionesses back in front eight minutes later, shoving off her marker before slotting her shot into the bottom corner. The Women\'s Super Leagues first million pound star Russo then sealed the deal with her tidy finish into the bottom corner in the 86th minute. With the win England\'s Lionesses have made history by reaching their first World Cup final. And we\'re all desperate for them to repeat their trick of winning the Euros last year.'}

The star driver made a healthy £7million profit after selling the rare supercar for £8.5m last year. The 36-year-old purchased the vehicle for £1.6m with the motor specifically made for the seven-time Formula One world champion. But yesterday it was pictured severely damaged after a crash in the Penmaenbach Tunnel on the A55 expressway in Conwy, North Wales. Ethan Gale, a supercar photographer posted pictures of the damage on Instagram and wrote: "Very sad day in the motoring world this evening. "A car I never thought I would see. "Ever since seeing this on YouTube driving around Monaco back in the day, it’s always been a dream car to tick off the list. "Late this afternoon this Pagani Zonda 760 LH previously owned by Lewis Hamilton had crashed in the Penmaenbach tunnel, Conwy, North wales. "Hopefully the car gets a full restoration and is back on the road in the future." The one-off car, which boasts a purple exterior, was personally ordered from Horacio Pagani by Hamilton seven years ago. The Zonda 760 LH is capable of reaching 217mph, and can go from 0-60mph in less than three seconds. Hamilton once famously crashed the whip into three parked cars in 2015 in Monte Carlo ahead of the Brazilian Grand Prix. He revealed that the accident was a result of heavy partying and a lack of sleep that caused him to lose control. The Arsenal fan remarked: "It was a result of heavy partying and not much rest for a week and a half. "I am a bit run down. I have been non-stop and trying to fit training in at the same time and not getting a lot of sleep.”'}

Katie Loxton, 27, embarked on a relationship with 32-year-old Adam Higgs while working at HMP Oakwood in Staffordshire. The couple spoke on the phone for more than 380 hours in 3,451 different calls during their six-month tryst. Higgs also used the contraband phone to message Loxton on social media. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard the pair would often "perform sexual acts to each other" during the calls. Loxton has now been jailed for 12 months for misconduct in a public office. Higgs was handed an eight-month sentence for possessing inside a prison a device capable of transmitting or receiving images, sounds or information by electronic communications. The pair also admitted transmitting or causing the transmission of an image/sound by electronic means from within a prison. The court was told Loxton was arrested on January 27 last year.

While mating season usually begins in early September, when the little beasties search for somewhere to live over the winter, our cooler summer means many are beginning their hunt early. Male spiders often come into houses in search of females that have remained lurking indoors in places such as bathrooms and kitchen cabinets. Here, we look at what these giant spiders are, and pest controller Stuart Halliday gives his tips on how to get rid of them for good. Many different spider species will invade our homes this autumn, but the giant house spider is the one you will see most often. They live in sheds, attics, homes and out-buildings and can survive for several months without any food or water. They can have leg spans of up to 12cm and are seen all year round but mate in the autumn time. Entomologist Brian Eversham told ITV news there is a simple explanation for why they appear so big - that they grow during the spring and pop up this time of year as adults. "This happens every year - during the spring time they are often quite small, and come late summer and adult, the spiders are adults," he said. "They are fast moving, so they are the ones that people tend to notice. The females, quite sensibly, sit quietly in a corner of a room in their web, catching insects. People almost never notice that they\'ve got female house spiders, tucked away in a shaded corner. "The males go walking around, looking for the females, and that\'s when people tend to notice them. People think that there are suddenly a lot more, but it\'s just that they have started behaving differently." Although, this spider is called the \'giant\' spider, it\'s not the biggest in the UK. The cardinal spider is the largest spider across the British isles. Otherwise known as Tegenaria parietina, some of these spiders have been recorded to have a leg span of 12cm. It normally lives for two or three years, but lifetimes of up to six years have been observed. While the female only leaves its nest to feed, males can often be seen wandering around houses during the late summer and early autumn looking for a mate. This so-called "spider season" normally begins in the first two weeks of September and ends by the first week of October. Keeping your house clean is the most effective way to deter spiders. Dust and vacuum any spider webs or egg sacs (which will be ball shaped, and often hidden in the web) waiting to hatch. Spiders will be less eager to return when their offspring and habitats have been removed. If you do this as soon as you spot them, it will make cleaning a whole lot easier. Top of the list and perhaps the easiest (and most fragrant) is to use peppermint oil to deter our eight-legged friends. After cleaning your home, you can mix up a two-part solution by adding around 20 drops of peppermint oil to a bottle of water. Simply pour this into a spray bottle and spritz all around your house. Bottles of peppermint oil cost as little as £2 online for 10ml. And the good news is that with 20 drops equating to around 1ml, you can whip up a handy homemade spray for just 20p. Citrus and eucalyptus are also good alternatives. You can peel lemons and oranges and leave the peel in places where spiders might like to hide to put them off, but replace it regularly as the aroma won’t last forever. Another simple way to stop the crawlies getting in is to seal up any cracks around your doors and windows, according to pest control expert Stuart Halliday. "Sometimes if you have your windows changed, or if you live in an older property, there can be gaps both on the inside and outside meaning spiders and other insects can get in," he said. "You should make sure these are sealed up and then to help keep the spiders out put lemongrass cleaners or oil around windows and doors as they don\'t like the smell. "Also growing basil, thyme and rosemary on windowsills will keep the pests out and deter wasps, woodlice and other small crawlies."'}

"I don\'t remember being frightened of being interviewed by Michael, because it was just like talking to a really good friend," she said. "His enjoyment and love of doing it, it was a complete joy to watch. He never shunned asking a direct question." In his tribute, Sir Elton added: "I loved his company and his incredible knowledge of cricket and Barnsley Football Club. A real icon who brought out the very best in his guests." Beckham appeared on Parkinson with wife Victoria in 2001, when she famously revealed his Goldenballs nickname. The former footballer wrote: "I was so lucky to not just be interviewed by Michael but to be able to spend precious time talking about football and family, our 2 passions. Plus the GoldenBalls moment…" Actor Sir Michael Caine said: "Michael Parkinson was irreplaceable, he was charming, always wanted to have a good laugh. He brought the best of everyone he met. Always looked forward to be interviewed by him." A statement from the chat show host\'s family on Thursday said: "After a brief illness Sir Michael Parkinson passed away peacefully at home last night in the company of his family. "The family request that they are given privacy and time to grieve." As told to BBC Radio 4\'s The World At One As a viewer, you knew if Michael was asking the questions, there were going to be good questions, and they would elicit good answers. As a network controller, I thought he was the best freelance interviewer in the business. He was always knowledgeable, he was absolutely classless. You knew he was not a southerner, you knew he was a northerner, and that was a very refreshing voice in those days. You knew that he would do his homework, and that he would ask questions that didn\'t occur to you, as well as those that did. I thought he was the best interviewer in the business at that time. He was extremely generous. He wanted you to shine, and not particularly himself. He would always laugh at your jokes, and give you an opportunity to make them sound funnier than in fact they were. When you were told that he was going to be the interviewer, it was like meeting a friend. Though in fact we didn\'t meet very often, but you knew that he was on your side as much as on his own. He was Saturday night television, and there\'s nobody like him doing the sort of things that he did when his career was at its height. Television doesn\'t give that kind of space to interviews these days, to its loss, and of course Michael did it better than anybody. I remember he was interviewing me and Billy Connolly together, and of course Billy Connolly made both of us laugh a lot but he laughed even at my jokes, and my stories, and, as it were, looked after me to make sure I wasn\'t swamped by Billy Connolly, who is after all a very big character. With Michael, it was always friendly, always thorough, always intelligent, always a pleasure to do it, and I think that came over no matter who his interviewee was. He always knew what the interesting bits were, and he steered you through that sort of thing. He was always generous in the way he framed his questions. He wanted you, his interviewee, to shine. I didn\'t ever see him uncomfortable, he was unflappable. It didn\'t matter what you did, whether it was a puppet that tried to consume him, or if he was interviewing a great intellect, he was always in charge, but not dominantly so. Comedian and travel presenter Sir Michael Palin described the broadcaster as "incisive and very sharp". Sir Michael told The World At One: "He wanted to get people on his show who entertained him and therefore who he thought would entertain the audience. He was not picky. He was not trying to diss anybody. He was an enthusiast and he was very positive. "It didn\'t always work," he noted. "In some cases, [interviewees] suspected what they saw as the difficult questions he might ask in among all the fun and the enjoyment. "Because he was a very good journalist, and a very proud journalist, and it was very important for him not to give people an easy ride. But he did basically choose people he liked, because he liked to be entertained himself." On social media, TV presenter Davina McCall described Sir Michael as "unique and always so well researched". "[He was] loved by all the biggest stars in the world and they were all desperate to be interviewed by him," she continued. "Funny, self deprecating, sharp, charming, strong, honest and a fantastic listener. His legacy is enormous." Former prime minister Theresa May said Sir Michael was "a remarkable man and an outstanding broadcaster". "We knew each other well through his charitable work in my constituency and our mutual passion for cricket. My thoughts and prayers are with his family," she added. Match of the Day host Gary Lineker described Sir Michael a "a truly brilliant broadcaster and wonderful interviewer", while presenter Dermot O\'Leary said he was "one of the greats". "But above all else he listened… in a world full of noise," O\'Leary added. "RIP Michael, thanks for the education." Boxer Frank Bruno praised Sir Michael\'s ability "to frame and gift wrap the guest to deliver to the TV viewer".

That is almost back to pre-pandemic levels. It follows a spike in top grades in 2020 and 2021, when exams were cancelled because of Covid. The drop is steeper in England, where grades were due to be brought back in line with 2019 in this year\'s results. In Wales and Northern Ireland, grades were always meant to be a bit higher this year. Overall, there are 73,008 fewer top grades compared with 2022, but 31,834 more than in 2019. The pass rate for exams in Scotland fell last week - but was still higher than before the pandemic. The fall in top grades will mean disappointment for some students, but it has got nothing to do with students\' individual performance. It is part of a plan to bring grades back down in line with pre-pandemic levels, after sharp rises in 2020 and 2021 when exams were cancelled and results were based on teachers\' assessments. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) said 79% of 18-year-olds applying to university got a place at their first choice - which is lower than last year, but higher than before the pandemic. Another 9% did not get into their firm or insurance choice of university and are in clearing, Ucas\'s online system that advertises courses with vacancies. Ucas has previously warned that spaces on some courses at top universities would "go quite quickly" in clearing, with the number of 18-year-olds in the population growing and international applications to undergraduate courses up slightly on last year. AS-level results are also being released which, in Wales and Northern Ireland, count towards students\' final A-level results next summer. And 3,448 students in England are receiving vocational T-level qualifications in England. The pass rate was 90.5%, and 69.2% of students achieved a merit or above. By Christina McSorley and Rahib Khan, education reporters Lara, 18, is planning to move out of her family home in London and head to university in the next few weeks. She was disappointed when she did not get the grades she wanted in her English literature, maths and computer science A-levels - but has since found a place through clearing. "Luckily my parents and my teacher were on hand to offer me support and we got on the phone to clearing immediately," she said. "Everyone should be proud of what they have achieved and remember, if you don\'t get the grades you want there are still so many options available to you." Lara is a registered young carer for her younger sister, and says moving to university does "bring up some anxieties". "I\'ll still be available to phone and pop down to visit, but there is that anxiety that I will be leaving and I\'m not sure how either of us will react to that situation," she said. With the support of her parents and family and the Carers Trust charity, Lara says she is ready to take the next step and would encourage other young carers to reach out and get some help. "Hollie, my sister, would like to turn my room into a Lego room when I leave," she says. "She is very excited." There was a steeper drop in the proportion of A-levels marked at A* and A in England than elsewhere: Exams were cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of Covid. Pupils\' grades were based on teachers\' predictions instead, leading to a spike in top results. England\'s exams watchdog, Ofqual, set out a two-year plan to bring A-level and GCSE results back down to pre-pandemic levels. Last year was the first time students sat exams since the start of the pandemic. Ofqual called it a "transition year", with grades set to reflect a midway point between 2019 and 2021. About 36.4% of A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were marked at A* and A. Now, in the second stage of the plan, grades in England are more similar to those in 2019, when 25.4% of A-levels were given the top grades. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said bringing them back down would ensure results carried "weight and credibility" with employers, universities and colleges, so they know what the different grades mean. However, this year\'s A-level students also suffered from disruption because of Covid. Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said students getting A-level and other Level 3 results had faced "unprecedented circumstances". Most of them were in Year 10 when the pandemic hit and their GCSEs were cancelled, so this is the first time they have sat formal exams. The impact on pupils was not equal, and MPs have warned it could take a decade for the gap between disadvantaged pupils and others to narrow to what it was before Covid. These students have also faced disruption from teacher strikes this year, although unions said they tried to minimise the impact on exam year groups. The Covid disruption means things are not quite back to normal. Ofqual says there was "protection built into the grading process" so that students should achieve the grades they would have done if the pandemic had not happened - even if they did not perform as well in their exams. Some Covid measures also remained in place for this year\'s exams. A-levels were spaced apart more than they were before the pandemic, allowing for rest and revision. But, unlike in the rest of the UK, A-level students in England were not given advance information about the topics on which they would be tested. The Higher Education Policy Institute said this week that "England has probably got it wrong" by trying to get back to normal "too quickly". Jo Saxton, the head of Ofqual, told the BBC that students in England would not be disadvantaged because universities had been pre-warned that different nations were taking different approaches.

More than 60 people are feared to have died on the boat, which was at sea for over a month. Most were from Senegal. "Everyone is shocked. He was one of the pillars of our family," Mamour Ba said about his brother Cheikhouna. But the 27-year-old said he would still attempt the trip himself as it was impossible to make a living in Senegal. Mr Ba, 27, is a student from the small fishing town of Fass Boye, halfway along the coast between the capital, Dakar, and the historical town of St Louis. Three of his brothers and one of his cousins were on the wooden pirogue style boat that set off for Europe on 10 July from Fass Boye with 101 people on board. "They wanted to get to Spain. They said they wanted to leave and I couldn\'t tell them not to because they\'d already made their minds up." He thought they had all died, until he got a call from Cape Verde on Wednesday after their rescue. They were among 38 people, including children, who were saved, with footage showing them being helped ashore, some on stretchers, on the island of Sal. More than 60 other people are feared to be lost at sea. The archipelago sits around 600km (372 miles) off the coast of West Africa and on the migration route to the Canary Islands, a Spanish territory seen by many as a route to the EU. Mr Ba says he still does not know the details of his relatives\' five-week journey as they were too disorientated: "They didn\'t have the strength to explain what happened, they just said: \'We\'re alive\'. They sounded very weak." But as the conversation continued, he found out that not all of them had survived. "One of my brothers, Ibrahima, used one of the doctor\'s phones to call me from Cape Verde. "He told us our other brother Cheikhouna was lost at sea. I was shocked. We were very close, he was a real fighter. He was married with two kids. "The day he left he held my hands and said, \'Brother I have to go.\' "He was my brother, he was my friend." After news of the tragedy spread in Fass Boye, where most of those on board the boat hailed from, anger erupted on Wednesday. Some set fire to the house of the mayor, angered with the authorities about the lack of opportunities for young people. This frustration is something Mr Ba is all too familiar with - he has tried at least twice to leave Senegal. "There was nothing for me here... so I decided I needed to try to move to Europe via Morocco," he said, speaking of his first attempt during his third year at university. Things did not work out though, and he was forced to return home after spending nine months there. But he was determined to achieve his dream of moving to Europe - and tried again, this time just a few weeks ago, at the end of June, with Cheikhouna. But the attempt failed. "This latest trip was Cheikhouna\'s second attempt at getting to Europe by boat. Three days after we came back, he had set off again," Mr Ba said. "He was determined to leave because he had a family and there\'s nothing for us here in Senegal. "We\'re fishermen, we work all day and we make no money. He just wanted to feed his family and have a better life." Mr Ba knows it is risky to try to board another boat to Europe, but it comes down to finances. "I don\'t have the money to take a plane. It\'s better to pay 300,000 CFA ($480, £375) or 400,000 CFA to go to Spain than to spend millions trying to get there by plane." He says he is not scared of drowning. "Others have done this journey and have drowned but it doesn\'t put me off. It\'s a risk I\'m willing to take. Even if there was a boat ready to go today, I\'d take it."

Six men died after the vessel they were aboard got into difficulty near Calais on Saturday. More than 50 other people were rescued by French and British coastguards. French judges are also reportedly considering further charges against the Iraqi and Sudanese suspects. At least two of those detained are thought to have links to human trafficking networks, according to French media. The people on board were reported to be mainly Afghan, with some Sudanese also present. Karim was one of about 10 people who was turned away from boarding the vessel due to overcrowding, despite paying people smugglers €2,000 ($2,200; £1,700) for a place. He told the BBC the smugglers promised him a "good boat" - something at least 10m (32ft) long - but what they were given was only 3m long. Two of his friends were allowed aboard and Karim thinks they were among those who died. Another man, Idris, managed to survive the journey but has ended up back in France. "There were far too many passengers," the 22-year-old told the Reuters news agency. "The waves were very strong, and the boat split up. "Half the passengers fell into the water and were swallowed up by the sea. Those who were left in the boat tried to stay alive with the help of their lifebuoys." Rescue workers on Saturday said it was the seventh time that week that they had pulled people from the water, raising concerns that the smugglers organising the crossings may be using a defective batch of boats. The English Channel is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, with 600 tankers and 200 ferries passing through it every day. Despite this, many people are willing to take the risk. Figures released on Thursday show more than 17,000 migrants have arrived in the UK so far this year after crossing the Channel. More than 400 people arrived in small boats on Wednesday alone. The BBC also spoke to Zhala in Calais, who said she was fleeing gun attacks in Iraq with her young family. They have repeatedly tried to get on a boat. "It\'s fate," she said when asked what she thought about Saturday\'s sinking. "It\'s not dangerous for us. We\'ve come across so many difficulties in my country." A migrant from South Sudan, who has set up a camp hidden in the bushes on the coastline, told the BBC he was adamant to get to the UK to make a success of himself. He said: "[The UK} colonised me in Sudan, that\'s why. It\'s like my father." Explaining why he wants to leave Sudan, he explained he was leaving because of war and corruption. But French authorities have threatened to move him and his fellow countryman from their makeshift camp, he added. Karim said he is also still looking to try and make it across into the UK. Aid workers in Calais say more migrants have been arriving in recent weeks and have been living rough on the coastline. They say many of them are determined to get to the UK, despite warnings over the dangers of the crossing.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

A divorce petition filed late on Wednesday, seen by BBC News, cites "irreconcilable differences" between Asghari, 29, and Spears, 41. The couple got engaged in September 2021 and were married in a small but star-studded ceremony in June 2022. But rumours of their marital struggles have been splashed across US tabloids this year. Representatives for Spears and Asghari have not yet commented. The musician did not address the divorce in a Wednesday night post to her 42 million Instagram followers, instead writing that she was "buying a horse soon". According to the dissolution of marriage petition filed by Asghari in Los Angeles County Superior Court, he asks that spousal support and attorneys\' fees be paid by Spears. The Iranian-American actor, model and fitness trainer met Spears while she was shooting the video for her song, Slumber Party, in 2016. He played a key role during her conservatorship fight with father Jamie, sporting a Free Britney T-shirt on Instagram before a crucial court hearing. Their wedding, at the superstar\'s home in Thousand Oaks, California last year, was an intimate and lavish affair attended by celebrities including Paris Hilton, Madonna and Drew Barrymore. The two had recently been seen without their wedding rings in public. The separation comes as Spears prepares to publish her memoir - The Woman in Me - this October. It marks the end of her third marriage. In 2004, she married childhood friend Jason Alexander for 55 hours in Las Vegas, before she annulled the nuptials at the urging of her management team. Mr Alexander, who was seen participating in the pro-Trump riot at the US Capitol in Washington DC in January 2021, attempted to crash Spears\' wedding to Asghari hours before they tied the knot. He was charged with trespassing, vandalism and two counts of battery, and has been court ordered to stay away from her. Spears\' second marriage - to rapper Kevin Federline - lasted from 2004 to 2007. Federline retains sole custody of their two children, Jayden James and Sean Preston.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

In a statement to his Instagram account on Thursday, the actor, 29, wrote: 'After 6 years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together.' He continued: 'We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always,' adding: 'S**t happens.' 'Asking for privacy seems ridiculous so I will just ask for everyone including media to be kind and thoughtful.' The latest update comes amid reports the Toxic singer, 41, got physical with Asghari several times and once gave him a black eye as he slept. Asghari reportedly told friends that the pop princess would attack him during their seven years together, sources told TMZ, adding there were numerous fights where security had to step in between the pair. The model was reportedly left stunned after his then-wife started punching him as he was sleeping in their bed. He was pictured with bruising on his arms and face earlier this year, with sources saying the dates coincide with the alleged attack. Sources claim that Asghari was concerned with the Toxic star's fascination with knives, which were littered across the singer's $11.8 million home in Thousand Oaks, California. One told TMZ that Britney was 'was paranoid someone was going to get her, and she needed the knives as protection.' The star is also accused of 'flying off the handle' at the smallest things, which left Asghari terrified. Insiders on Thursday told TMZ that Asghari had suspected that the Grammy-winning singer had cheated on him with a staffer at the Southern California home they shared; and that video footage shot on the property implicates Spears in being unfaithful. Asghari was suspicious that the Womanizer vocalist - described by sources as being in 'a fragile and hyper-sexualized state' - had also asked a staffer to film her while she was naked. Spears' alleged behavior was described by a source to the outlet as risky 'to her own safety;' and that her infidelity was what persuaded Asghari to move forward in his divorce filing. The latest details in the split come after DailyMail.com revealed that their relationship had descended into a dark and desperate state in the final weeks of their union. Sources revealed how Asghari thought he could 'save her', only to realize after 13 months of marriage that here may well be no chance of ever 'saving Britney.' 'The reality of life with Britney was that it was not fun and it's not a surprise at all that the marriage didn't last,' the insider shared. Asghari cited 'irreconcilable differences' when he filed for divorce from the singer - as sources claim that he felt he couldn't leave Spears alone. According to court docs, Asghari is asking the multi-millionaire for spousal support and to cover his attorneys fees. DailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for Britney for comment. Asghari's lawyer Neal Hersh said that their finances need to be determined — despite the couple having an 'iron clad' prenup in place that protects the singer's premarital assets. The prenup stated that he was entitled to '$1 million per every two years' of their marriage, with a cap at $10 million after 15 years, according to US Weekly. He has also allegedly waived any claims to Britney's music collection, and his name is not listed on the deeds of their shared home. Spears raised eyebrows on Sunday when she posted a bizarre video of herself dancing on a stripper pole in a skimpy leopard-print lingerie set after the news of their breakup became public. In the since-deleted video, the hitmaker was dancing in the raunchy clip to Nine Inch Nails' X-rated song Closer, a classic of edgy dance and industrial music. She was spotted for the first time since the split, behind the wheel of her white Mercedes-Benz as she drove around in Los Angeles. Her ring-free hand was displayed as she steered the wheel of her luxury vehicle down a winding road near her Thousand Oaks home. Britney has yet to comment on the divorce news, but she did break her silence by sharing a bizarre Instagram post about vowing to buy a horse 'soon.' Since tying the knot in 2022, Britney has added to her fortune by signing a $15 million deal with publishing house Simon & Schuster for a tell-all memoir titled The Woman In Me. But it could be that the book may serve as a reminder for another failed relationship, with the happy ending of their marriage meant to serve as an important narrative. The star also returned to music by releasing two new singles, a new version of Tiny Dancer with Elton John, and Mind Your Business with will.i.am. Page Six reported that Britney has hired celebrity divorce attorney Laura Wasser — who boasts A-list clients such as Kim Kardashian, Kevin Costner and Johnny Depp. But it's been alleged that Asghari is threatening to release 'extraordinarily embarrassing' information about his spouse if she refuses to renegotiate the terms — something a source close to Spears told DailyMail.com is 'absurd.' She previously enlisted Wasser's help in 2008 as she fought her ex-husband Kevin Federline, 45, over custody of their two sons. The exes — who split in 2006 after two years of marriage — share Jayden James, 16, and Sean Preston, 17. A judge ordered Spears to pay $20,000 a month in child support — a decision that Wasser said the Piece Of Me hitmaker felt 'great' about. The monthly payments reportedly increased to $60,000 in 2018 and Kevin has full custody of the boys. He reportedly moved the family to Hawaii last month, without saying goodbye to Britney. Wasser is huge proponent for prenups regardless of wealth status as she believes marrying someone is the 'biggest decision of your life.'

Walker had just taken a bite when her husband, Borhan, announced he no longer wanted to be married. She had icing sugar on her face and assumed it was a joke — but he was perfectly serious. There had been no fighting, no arguments — but he wanted out. Walker had form when it came to break-ups, having already 'left God'. Raised in the Baha'i Faith (which believes in the unity and equality of humanity, and in one God), she married at 20, had sex for the first time on her wedding night, and didn't touched a drop of alcohol ('not even in a plum pudding') until she was 28. Unlike her husband, who 'left God like Noel Gallagher left Oasis', Walker's faith gradually ebbed away into a state of doubt. She maintained a facade with her family — not swearing, smoking or drinking when she was with them, making excuses not to participate in Faith activities. She stepped away so stealthily no one suspected she'd left her religion. Aged 35, unmoored by the end of not one relationship but two, Walker packed up her three children and moved to a rental: adrift in a 'sea of unbelieving'. But this is not, she says, a book about divorce or God. (Not entirely, anyway.) 'Like everything else, this is about love.' Lost and bewildered Walker may be when we first meet her, but she comes from a family with an extraordinary capacity for love. Her memoir reads like a novel — a sprawling, intimate, intergenerational family saga. And what a family. Warm, wise and anchored by not one but five strong women: Walker's grandmother, Dolly; her mother, Fari; and her remarkable aunties, Mehri, Irie and Mona, who dispense love, well-intentioned advice, and chai in equal measure. It is a family of cousins who feel like siblings, full of whispered intimacies and unspoken, affectionate shorthand. Walker's own story is a springboard into the family's past as she skates elegantly between generations and around the globe. She takes us from Tehran in 1946, where widowed Dolly cleans, sews and scrimps to keep her five children to India in 1952, where a terrified Fari cowers in a mulberry tree, chanting a magic prayer against a black panther. In 1966, Dolly and her daughters flee heartbreak, in search of a new life in Australia where, in 1980s Toowoomba, four-year-old Sita — her parents' fourth child, her father's 'precious treasure' — eats chapatis and begs Dolly to sing You Are My Sunshine yet again. Intertwined throughout is the ending of Walker's marriage. After Borhan's declaration over that vanilla slice, they drift towards a civilised separation until, in 2015, they mark their divorce by taking hallucinogenic drugs together in the forest. A novel approach which certainly promises more excitement than arguing in a lawyer's office. This, Borhan tells her, will allow them to subconsciously uncouple. In her drug-induced state Walker sees her family's souls as elements. And, suddenly, she understands: she is fire and so is he. Together they are 'too much fire'. Little wonder their relationship is a 'ravaged' landscape. The matriarchs gather her to their collective bosom. Her students — she is clearly an excellent and loved English teacher — notice that she is different and shyly offer their sympathy. And then there is a new love affair — with Anthony, a kind, interesting, charming actor, who kisses 'like Joseph Fiennes in Shakespeare In Love'. (This quality is accorded the reverence it warrants.) Walker has an eagle ear for dialogue, an eye for absurdity, and is drolly self-deprecating. She tells us that this is 'no post-divorce Eat, Pray, Love'. But on a more modest scale, it is — as told by Nora Ephron. Food is offered as comfort incarnate, there is faith and there is an abundance of love. Walker realises she must listen to the women who raised her for the fate of her soul. In the words of redoubtable Aunty Mona, take the fear from her heart and fill it with love. For that, and only that, is the answer.", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Jessica Horne, 33, also racially abused a cabin crew member while flying on a Ryanair jet from Fuerteventura to Manchester in March 2022. Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court heard how Horne - who has three previous convictions for attacking police - had been drinking all day before boarding the 8pm flight and had also bought a bottle of Grey Goose vodka to drink on board. Lisa Boocock, prosecuting, said that mid way through the flight an 'intoxicated' Horne, who was travelling with her partner and their young son, was spotted vaping in her seat. A male member of crew 'told her to stop five times' and eventually took the vape from her. He then guided Horne, who'd got into an argument with her partner, to the rear of the aircraft to calm her down but it had 'little effect', Ms Boocock said. Her partner was so concerned about her behaviour he spoke to the crew member while a 'Good Samaritan' gave up their seat in a further attempt to calm the situation. Horne, of Briercliffe, Burnley, then started to touch the crew member and tried to kiss him on the cheek, the court heard. She also demanded he return her vape, grabbed him and stroked his name badge, leaving him 'feeling uncomfortable'. When the crew member - who is of Fillipino origin - refused, Horne racially abused him calling him a 'f****** c****' and a 'cheeky c****' several times. She also told him: 'Go back home'. The crew member was left so 'distressed', Ms Boocock said, he asked the captain to divert the plane but 'that wasn't practical' and he described the incident as the 'worst he'd ever had' with a passenger in four years of flying. Fortunately, Horne fell asleep 40 minutes before the flight was due to land and was arrested by police when the plane touched down. But she spat at one officer and punched and scratched another, leaving her with a black eye and cut to the top of her eyelid. She also swore at them, calling them: 'C****.' In a victim impact statement, the female officer said she expected to deal with intoxicated people but the attack had left her explaining her injuries to her family who were already 'fearful' about her role. It had affected her confidence, she said, and she couldn't understand why she had been assaulted when she was just trying to do her job. The court heard Horne has a number of previous convictions for similar offences. In February 2017, she was handed a 12-week curfew after racially abusing a taxi driver and a police officer, who she kicked in the shins. But the curfew was later lifted so she could could attend a weekend Centre Parcs holiday to celebrate her mum's 60th birthday. A few months later she attacked two police officers, kicking one in his privates and labelling his female colleague a 'lesbian c***', but was given a conditional discharge by magistrates. In 2018, she walked free from court again for carrying out a third attack on a police officer. For the latest incident, Horne pleaded guilty to charges of being drunk on an aircraft, two counts of assaulting an emergency worker and of racially aggravated harassment. The prosecution chose to offer no evidence on a fifth charge of sex assault, which will lie on file. Christian Kavanagh, defending, said Horne had made 'drastic changes in her character to address her behaviour' and was 'disgusted' by her actions. She acknowledged the impact it had on other passengers, he said, and she had a 'clear motivation' to address her issues. The court heard Horne's drinking had escalated during a previous abusive relationship, which resulted in her partner being jailed twice. The judge, Mr Recorder Imran Shafi KC, said Horne had a 'huge problem with alcohol' and labelled her behaviour 'disgraceful'. He said she had acted like she was on 'private flight and could behave how she felt' and not on a Ryanair holiday flight with other passengers 'who had to put up with your behaviour for four hours'. The judge described her attacks of the two police officers as 'thuggery' and said he had considered jailing her but was mindful she had three children aged 3, 9 and ten. Therefore, he decided to hand Horne an 18-month sentence, suspended for two years, and imposed 90-day rehabilitation order of alcohol abatement and monitoring. Horne was also ordered to pay the female police officer £1,000 in compensation.", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Think again. A powerful new book by a former prison officer argues jail time neither punishes nor rehabilitates — and leaves some inmates in such despair they seek the only way out...", 'byline': 'PETER HITCHENS FOR THE DAILY MAIL', 'time': '2023-08-17T22:01:24+0100', 'text': "BOOK OF THE WEEK BEHIND THESE DOORS by Alex South (Hodder & Stoughton £16.99, 352pp) Most people have pretty strong feelings about what prisons should be like. Hardly anyone knows what they are like. Half the population is convinced they are holiday camps where unrepentant villains feast on smuggled fillet steaks. The other half thinks they are unjust hellholes whose inmates should for the most part be let out. Neither of these beliefs is correct. The truth is in some ways quite a lot worse. The miserable result of this empty controversy is that nothing intelligent is ever done about our jails. So they grow worse. And we will pay for this. As experienced officers retire, there will be violence and chaos will increase. And it will be unendurable to think that there are innocent people in there, at the mercy of unrestrained savagery. For there are. Alex South — a brave young woman who became a prison officer — endured danger, misery and near-despair, and has written a superb, compelling book about these experiences. Everyone should read it. It is not what you might expect. Though the complex issue of female officers in male prisons is touched on quite a lot, it is not really a huge part of the book. It is fairly obvious that these officers can do a lot of good, but sometimes at great peril to themselves. South is a likeable and candid guide to this dark world. Perhaps her strongest message is this. It is upon the prison officers — patient, thoughtful, courageous, diplomatic and stoical — that the safety and peace of our prisons chiefly depend. Yet they simply do not have the public esteem which is still — often unjustifiably — given to the police. Instead, many of them go quietly crazy with the things they have to do. Now, the older, experienced men (perhaps guessing what is to come) are leaving and, as she warns: 'A storm is coming'. South was not fooled by the criminals she watched over, nor beguiled or tricked by them. She knew the terrible things they had done to others and sometimes tried to do to her. She was subjected to a vile false accusation, she was covered in blood and she was knocked unconscious in a dreadful fight. Yet she tried to do good, even when it was thankless, to people who most of us would cross the street to avoid. She and her fellow officers also sought to sustain human kindness, and to prevent harm, injury and death. They did not always succeed. If this book is right, they will succeed even less in the future. A hundred years ago, a fiercely moral society believed that prisons were for 'the due punishment of responsible persons', and there was little or no pretence that they were there to try to make people better. Beds were hard, discipline was hard, work was hard; the cells were cold and the food basic. Warders, as they were then called, were in charge. Now, all that is lost. But it has not been replaced by the liberal paradise which 1960s reformers presumably hoped for. For one thing, our softer prisons are far fuller — because they no longer deter the borderline cases from committing crime. In 1961, before Home Secretary Roy Jenkins diluted the criminal justice system, there were 27,000 prisoners in England and Wales, in drug-free prisons, more or less totally controlled by the authorities. Nowadays, there are around 80,000, in prisons swirling with drugs and weapons, where a pitifully small number of officers try to keep control, and increasingly fail. The alarming descriptions of sudden violent explosions in South's book are a warning of the future. Not long before she decides to leave, she writes: 'I can't guarantee a prisoner's safety. There's too much in the way. The phones and drugs and weapons and gangs and bullying. I can't guarantee anyone's safety. I can't guarantee my own.' In theory, we are trying to 'rehabilitate' those inside. In truth, we neither punish nor rehabilitate. Life in prison is a series of humiliations and deprivations, just as bad in their own way as the bread and water and porridge of the Victorian age — squalid accommodation, dreary food, the forced company in shared cells of people you would normally avoid with all your might.Plus an endless undercurrent of violence and menace made far worse by drugs and weapons. No wonder so many prisoners try to take the quick way out by hanging themselves. If you think we have abolished capital punishment, think again. We have it in large quantities — with despair doing regular service as the hangman. In one week, South records cutting down three hanged men. One died. One was revived but suffered permanent brain damage. Another was saved, but yelled at her, over and over again, 'Let me die!' Yet while some prefer death to prison, many offenders are barely touched by jail. They are not afraid of it. Actual served sentences are often shorter than the rehab courses the criminals are asked to undergo. The feebleness of police and courts means that many criminals do not enter prison until they have already committed so many crimes they can neither be deterred nor turned into better people. Anyway, how would modern British prisons turn their inhabitants into better people? There is little evidence that they do. Wormwood Scrubs, West London's vast Victorian jail, was clearly the worst (and most typical) experience of South's time in the prison service. She was surrounded by drugs, violence was almost normal, some prisoners were so far out of their minds — almost certainly due to drugs — that they plainly ought to have been in mental hospitals. The place was filthy, with rats everywhere. Basic security was so poor she actually witnessed a drone delivering two Big Macs to a cell window before swooping off into the London darkness. But next time, you see, it could be delivering a knife", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Sources claim the Mission: Impossible star hasn't visited the religion's UK headquarters for three years despite being based in Britain for most of that time", 'byline': 'ALISON BOSHOFF', 'time': '2023-08-17T22:00:35+0100', 'text': "Tom Cruise is Scientology's most famous member, but could he be losing his fervour? The actor was close friends with its leader David Miscavige, who was best man at his wedding to Katie Holmes in 2006, but sources say he has not flown his helicopter to Scientology's UK HQ in East Grinstead for around three years. During that time Cruise, 61, has been based mainly in the UK, making Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One, and has taken the chopper around the country, including to Birmingham and the Cotswolds. But not to East Grinstead - although Scientology does have a branch in Central London, which the actor could be attending. Spokesmen for Cruise and the church did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Scientology's UK HQ is Saint Hill Manor, in West Sussex, which was bought by the religion's founder L. Ron Hubbard in 1959 and was his family home before it was turned into a church. According to Scientology's website it 'provides advanced religious services to Scientologists from around the world'. Previously, Cruise had been in the habit of nipping down to West Sussex in his AS350 helicopter to visit the church. He has a pied-a-terre in London's Knightsbridge and would fly out of nearby Battersea heliport (where he was sometimes filmed by fans). Cruise's daughter Bella (from his marriage to second wife Nicole Kidman) lives in Croydon and is understood to work at Saint Hill, where there are around 400 staff. (Cruise and Kidman's son Connor is a game fisherman and cook who lives in Clearwater, Florida, where the religion has its global HQ.) Cruise's third wife, Katie Holmes, lives in New York with daughter Suri, 17. Neither she nor Kidman are Scientologists but Cruise's first wife, Mimi Rogers, was - and she introduced him to the religion, which he joined in 1986. It was reported in July 2021 that Cruise was 'drifting away' from the religion, as he had not been seen around Saint Hill Manor despite being in the country for filming work. Sources indicated that he had previously stayed at the manor on such occasions, although the change was attributed to concerns over gatherings during Covid. The UK Church of Scientology is small: the 2021 census showed fewer than 2,000 people in England and Wales described themselves as Scientologists. By contrast, over 8,000 said they believed in Shamanism.", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Gender is complex and not limited to "male" or "female". Furthermore, naming conventions vary by culture and individual preference, so it is not always possible to accurately determine the gender of a person by their name alone.

The hugely popular star and ex-cricket umpire Dickie shared memories in one of their regular phone calls. But that evening Parky passed following a brief illness. Dickie, 90, revealed: “I just can’t believe it. I only spoke to him on Wednesday. He was a true friend. “We talked about some of the moments of the happy times we spent together. “And I think he knew that he was coming to the end . . . we said our goodbyes.” Dickie, who was seen fighting back tears on Sky TV, also told Times Radio: “Our fathers worked down the coalmines. “Parky’s dad would have been very proud of his son. He was the best. “There will never be another like him. He never lost his love for cricket. It was his first love.” Parky’s death was announced in a statement this morning which said: “After a brief illness Sir Michael Parkinson passed away peacefully at home last night in the company of his family.” Parky was married to Mary, 87, for 64 years and the couple shared three sons. He interviewed the world’s \xadbiggest names on his self-titled show from 1971 — once estimating his total guests at 2,000. The programme was the highlight of Saturday nights. And today stars from screen, sport and politics paid tribute to the broadcaster whose TV career spanned seven decades. An opening batsman in his youth, Parky once kept England star Sir Geoffrey Boycott out of his hometown Barnsley cricket team. He had trials for Yorkshire and while he never cracked the first team like his two pals, the trio remained friends for life. Sir Geoffrey, 82, remembered Parky as the “soul of Yorkshire”. He said: “He was the best chat host because he listened to people. “He never lost his roots. Michael was Yorkshire in every way. “He understood how we think, how we talk. He was just a lovely man. He would laugh about himself with the emu. “He never lost his humour, his warmth, his Yorkshire in him that made him great.” One of Parky’s most memorable shows was his 1976 interview with comic Rod Hull and his pugnacious puppet Emu. Emu repeatedly pecked at Parky after he asked Rod: “Why is it so aggressive?”, leaving the chat host on the floor and missing a shoe. Parky later joked his career would always be remembered for “that bloody bird”. Millions watched his four punchy chats with boxing champ Muhammad Ali, and Parky later described him as the most extraordinary person he had ever met. Sir David Attenborough was interviewed by Parky many times and said today: “With Michael, it was always friendly, always thorough, always intelligent, always a pleasure to do it, and I think that came over no matter who his interviewee was.” Acting great Michael Caine added: “Michael Parkinson was irreplaceable, he was charming, always wanted to have a good laugh. “He brought the best of everyone he met. Always looked forward to be interviewed by him.” The chats didn’t always go well. In 1975 Parky suggested to Dame Helen Mirren, then 30, her “equipment” hindered her being recognised as a serious actress — leading to a frosty interview. In 2003 US actress Meg Ryan took offence at questions about her new film and gave one-word answers. When a desperate Parky asked what she’d do if giving the interview, she snapped: “Wrap it up.” He later called her “an unhappy woman”, while Ryan called him a “nut” and said he had spoken to her “like a disapproving dad”. Parky had faced health battles in recent years. In 2013 he revealed he had prostate cancer, but said he got the all-clear from doctors two years later. Five years ago he had to learn to walk again following back surgery. News of his death earlier today triggered an outpouring of affection. Writer Stephen Fry said: “Loved that man. “Having grown up watching him interview greats, my first appearance was impossibly thrilling for me. “The genius of Parky was that unlike most people he was always 100 per cent himself.” Match of the Day’s Gary Lineker said: “A truly brilliant broadcaster and wonderful interviewer. “He was very much part of Saturday nights growing up: Parkinson then Match of the Day. RIP Parky.” Superstar Sir Elton John said: “Michael Parkinson was a TV legend who was one of the greats.” TalkTV presenter Piers Morgan said: “Wonderful character, great writer, sublimely talented broadcaster, and hilarious lunch partner. Loved him.” Parky was born in 1935 in the pit village of Cudworth, South Yorks. He left school with two O-levels and got a job collating sports results on his local newspaper. He did a two-year military stint becoming the British Army’s youngest captain at the age of 20. Parky returned to journalism then switched to television as a current affairs presenter and reporter for Granada in the 1960s. US jazz singer Marion Montgomery was the first guest in 1971. The show initially ran for 11 years and in 1998 Parky returned to the BBC for another run. The show switched to ITV from 2004-7 and he was knighted the following year. In a 2004 chat with Aussie comic Barry Humphries, dressed as his character Dame Edna Everage, one saucy comment made Parky laugh so much he had to cut to an ad break. In all he filmed 650 episodes over 32 years, regularly pulling in nine million viewers. Of his guests, Parky said Scots comedian Sir Billy Connolly was the funniest, Tommy Cooper “either the brightest or silliest” and David Beckham and George Clooney “the best-looking”. Connolly found overnight fame when a taxi driver gave Parky a tape of one of his stand-up shows and persuaded him to have Billy as a guest. He went on to appear 15 times, including the last episode. Speaking of his style, Parky once said: “It doesn’t really matter how famous', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Carly and Adam Taylor, who face a police quiz over the suspected arson attack, flew to the Greek holiday island yesterday. They are staying at a £20,000-a-week villa near Corfu Town. Meanwhile Staffordshire Police said they would be “speaking to the owners” about the fire which destroyed the Crooked House. Questions have also been raised over the pub’s demolition just 36 hours after the August 5 blaze. The pub was sold by Marston’s Brewery last month to ATE Farms Limited, a firm controlled by former hairdresser and nail technician Carly, 34. It had been listed for sale for £675,000. Husband Adam, 44, is shareholder and ex-director of Himley Environmental Ltd which runs a landfill site next door to the pub in the village of Himley, Staffs. The couple’s Corfu break follows a recent trip to Dubai. Carly was seen dressed casually in black jogging bottoms, T-shirt and baseball cap at the airport. Adam, in shorts and T-shirt, was heard on his phone moaning about media coverage of the fire. Their five-bedroom holiday villa has two swimming pools, gym, tennis court, barbecue and pool table and boasts incredible sea and mountain views. It is understood the Taylors are due to stay for a week before returning to the UK to deal with the fallout from the pub blaze. They are current and former directors of 18 companies mainly involved in waste management and property development. Mystery still surrounds the pub fire after intruders were reportedly seen before it broke out. Staffordshire Police said in a statement that the force is investigating “all of the available evidence into the cause” of the fire with Staffordshire Fire and Rescue and no cause had yet been established. Meanwhile lawyers for South Staffordshire council are looking into potential breaches of the Town and Country Planning Act over the pub’s demolition. It has emerged the 18th century boozer, where coins and marbles famously rolled uphill along the bar, was put forward for listed status protection just days before it burnt down. If granted, the owners would have needed council permission for demolition. It has also been claimed the mechanical digger that demolished the charred ruins of the pub was hired before the blaze. Lyndon Thomas, the boss of the plant firm that owns the excavator, said his firm had delivered it days before the fire. Built in 1765 as a farmhouse, The Crooked House became a pub in the 19th century and got its name after subsidence from mining in the area caused the building’s distinctive 16-degree tilt. Earlier this month it was reported Mr Taylor was stopped from stripping another pub in nearby Willey, Warks. He is said to have ripped out the interior of the Sarah Mansfield Country Inn, bought from a brewery in 2020.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The Prince of Wales and the Prime Minister are to miss the match in Sydney, Australia, despite it being the Lionesses’ first appearance in the final. It comes as Spain’s Queen Letizia revealed she would be heading Down Under. Yesterday, Kensington Palace confirmed Prince William, who is president of the FA, would be roaring on the Lionesses from home. William is believed to be against the 9,400-mile flight as he wants to keep down his carbon footprint. The Prime Minister will also miss England’s first World Cup final since 1966, sending Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer instead. Royal expert Phil Dampier tweeted: “If Prince William as president of the FA isn’t going to the Women’s World Cup final we should be told why not. "If it was in Europe, he’d be there.” Mandu Reid, leader of the Women’s Equality Party, added: “No chance Prince William would be ‘missing in action’ if the England men’s football team made it to the World Cup final.” It comes as the Government faces calls to announce a day off if the Lionesses beat Spain.

The group, fronted by Chris Martin, had their career steered by Dave Holmes for almost their entire time as a band but now it has been revealed they secretly split last year. Now things have turned messy, as a lawsuit has been filed here in the UK as part of a contractual dispute. Coldplay was formed in 1997 after the group met as students at the University College of London. They are currently on their Music Of Spheres world tour and are in talks to play Glastonbury next year. The slot, which will be a headline performance on the Pyramid stage, would mark the 25th anniversary of their first performance at Worthy Farm. Although their last proper performance there was in 2016, Chris went for fun in 2017 and joined Kylie Minogue and Stormzy on stage during their sets in 2019. Then in 2021, the group performed a set as part of Glastonbury’s Live At Worthy Farm livestream after the festival was cancelled due to lockdown restrictions. They will also have a new album out by then, called Moon Music, with Chris teasing that it’s due “early next year.” Speaking about the record, and comparisons to their last LP, he said: “I wouldn’t say it’s a sequel but it’s related. It’s its own thing but it will be part of this same tour. It’s like a cousin. “We take a studio with us on tour. That’s the amazing thing about making records now is you can make them everywhere. I always go to the studio on days off. That’s my hobby.” Asked if it would feature collaborations, he continued: “I don’t know. That’s still to be decided. “I think we’re approaching collaborations slightly differently this time. But I’m really enjoying working on it.” He has also doubled down on the claim that the group will only ever release three more albums. Speaking in Italy, he added: “I just have a strong feeling in my heart that we are supposed to do 12 projects and that feels really right. “But after that we’d still like to do shows and tours. I think 12 albums is a lot.”', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The two gliders smashed into each other just after 3pm today in the skies above Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. One of the gliders crashed yards from a housing estate in the west of the town. Witness David Leach told the BBC: "I came out and we just looked up watching them circle right above us. "Then, all of a sudden, there was a mighty bang. "I think the end of the wing of one clipped the back end of one glider, chopping his tail end off - and one of them just came crashing down like a rocket." No details of any injuries have yet been released. The Air Accidents Investigations Branch said: "We have launched an investigation into a glider mid-air collision which occurred this afternoon near Melton Mowbray, Leicester. "We have deployed a team to the site." Another local said the pilot of one of the gliders walked across the field before knocking on her door. She said the unhurt pilot was "very shaken and concerned about the other pilot". Leicestershire Police said cops had scrambled to the crash site along with firefighters and ambulance crew. A spokeswoman for the housing estate said: "We can confirm that an incident took place on our Roundhouse Park site in Melton Mowbray involving a light aircraft. "We can confirm that all of the site staff are accounted for and there have been no reports of injuries on the ground.

The hospital also delayed calling the police despite months of warnings that the nurse may have been killing babies. The unit\'s lead consultant Dr Stephen Brearey first raised concerns about Letby in October 2015. No action was taken and she went on to attack five more babies, killing two. Letby has been found guilty of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder six others in a neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital, in Cheshire. The first five murders all happened between June and October 2015 and - despite months of warnings - the final two were in June 2016. BBC Panorama and BBC News have been investigating how Letby was able to murder and harm so many babies for so long. We spoke to the lead consultant in the unit - who first raised concerns about Letby - and also examined hospital documents. The investigation reveals a catalogue of failures and raises serious questions about how the hospital responded to the deaths. Dr Brearey says he demanded Letby be taken off duty in June 2016, after the final two murders. Hospital management initially refused. The BBC investigation also found: Before June 2015, there were about two or three baby deaths a year on the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital. But in the summer of 2015, something unusual was happening. In June alone, three babies died within the space of two weeks. The deaths were unexpected, so Dr Stephen Brearey, the lead consultant at the neonatal unit, called a meeting with the unit manager, Eirian Powell, and the hospital\'s director of nursing Alison Kelly. "We tried to be as thorough as possible," Dr Brearey says. A staffing analysis revealed Lucy Letby had been on duty for all three deaths. "I think I can remember saying, \'Oh no, it can\'t be Lucy. Not nice Lucy,\'" he says. The three deaths seemed to have "nothing in common". Nobody, including Dr Brearey, suspected foul play. But by October 2015, things had changed. Two more babies had died and Letby had been on shift for both of them. By this point, Dr Brearey had become concerned Letby might be harming babies. He again contacted unit manager Eirian Powell, who didn\'t seem to share his concerns. In an email, from October 2015, she described the association between Letby and the unexpected baby deaths as "unfortunate". "Each cause of death was different," she said, and the association with Letby was just a coincidence. Senior managers didn\'t appear to be worried. In the same month - October 2015 - Dr Brearey says his concerns about Letby were relayed to director of nursing Alison Kelly. But he heard nothing back. Dr Brearey\'s fellow consultants were also worried about Letby. And it wasn\'t just the unexpected deaths. Other babies were suffering non-fatal collapses, meaning they needed emergency resuscitation or help with breathing, with no apparent clinical explanation. Letby was always on duty. In February 2016, another consultant, Dr Ravi Jayaram, says he saw Letby standing and watching when a baby - known as Baby K - seemed to have stopped breathing. Dr Brearey contacted Alison Kelly and the hospital\'s medical director Ian Harvey to request an urgent meeting. In early March, he also wrote to Eirian Powell: "We still need to talk about Lucy". Three months went by, and another two babies almost died, before - in May that year - Dr Brearey got the meeting with senior managers he had been asking for. "There could be no doubt about my concerns at that meeting," he says. But others at the meeting appeared to be in denial. Dr Brearey said Mr Harvey and Ms Kelly listened passively as he explained his concerns about Letby. But she was allowed to continue working. By early June, yet another baby had collapsed. Then, towards the end of the month, two of three premature triplets died unexpectedly within 24 hours of each other. Letby was on shift for both deaths. After the death of the second triplet, Dr Brearey attended a meeting for traumatised staff. He says while others seemed to be "crumbling before your eyes almost", Letby brushed off his suggestion that she must be tired or upset. "No, I\'m back on shift tomorrow," she told him. "She was quite happy and confident to come into work," he says. For Dr Brearey and his fellow consultants, the deaths of the two triplets were a tipping point. That evening, Dr Brearey says he called duty executive Karen Rees and demanded Letby be taken off duty. She refused. Dr Brearey says he challenged her about whether she was making this decision against the wishes of seven consultant paediatricians - and asked if she would take responsibility for anything that might happen to other babies the next day. He says Ms Rees replied "yes". The following day, another baby - known as Baby Q - almost died, again while Letby was on duty. The nurse still worked another three shifts before she was finally removed from the neonatal unit - more than a year after the first incident. The suspicious deaths and collapses then stopped. Letby still wasn\'t suspended, however. Instead, she was moved to the hospital\'s risk and patient safety office. Here she is believed to have had access to sensitive documents relating to the hospital\'s neonatal unit. She also had access to some of the senior managers whose job it was to investigate her. On 29 June 2016, one of the consultants sent an email under the subject line: "Should we refer ourselves to external investigation?" "I believe we need help from outside agencies," he wrote. "And the only agency who can investigate all of us, I believe, is the police." But hospital managers thought otherwise. "Action is being taken," wrote medical director Ian Harvey in his reply.

They show how she messaged colleagues after she had killed babies, often informing them of the deaths. In turn, she received sympathy and concern. The texts show how she offered to work extra shifts on the neonatal intensive therapy unit (ITU). And, as her murders mounted, they also reveal how Letby reacted as the net of suspicion closed in on her. Here are some of the messages she sent. To protect the identities of the babies, and their parents, each baby has been named by a letter. The day after murdering Baby A, Letby messages colleagues saying she doesn\'t want to go back into the nursery or see the parents - who also had another twin on the unit, Baby B. She attacks Baby B some time before 11 June. Letby: It was the hardest thing I\'ve ever had to do. Letby: Just a big shock for us all. Hard coming in tonight & seeing the parents x x She messages one of the nurses to say she has asked to be assigned to work with another baby: 11 June 2015: Three days after murdering Baby A, she messages a manager of the neonatal unit, offering to work more shifts, saying she needs to throw herself back in: 13 June 2015: Five days after Baby A\'s murder, and the day before she kills Baby C, Letby has an irritable exchange with a colleague over her manager\'s refusal to let her go back to work in intensive care. She says when she worked at Liverpool Women\'s Hospital, she found she needed to go straight back and care for another baby "otherwise the image of the one you lost never goes". The colleague disagrees, telling her to take a break: Colleague: I agree with her don\'t think it will help. You need a break from full on ITU... It sounds very odd and I would be complete opposite. […] Letby: Forget i said anything, I\'ll be fine, It\'s part of the job just don\'t feel like there is much team spirit tonight X The conversation continues into the evening, until 23:09 when Letby signs off saying "Sleep well xx". Six minutes later, Baby C falls critically ill. Letby had been assigned to a child elsewhere in the unit, but that night she enters the nursery where Baby C is and feeds air into his stomach through a nasogastric tube, causing his collapse. Letby has a text conversation with the same colleague she had been speaking to the previous night: The morning after murdering Baby D, Letby sends a message to a colleague: Letby: We lost Baby D Colleague: What!!!! But she was improving. What happened. Colleague: Wanna chat? I can\'t believe you were on again. You having such a tough time The conversation continues later: Letby tells another colleague "what I\'ve seen has really hit me" but she brushes off the suggestion that she should see a counsellor. Letby: I can\'t talk about it now, I can\'t stop crying. I just need to get it out of my system. 30 June 2015: One of the other nurses messages Letby, saying it is odd that four babies have become dangerously unwell within a short period of time. Nurse: There\'s something odd about that night and the other 3 that went so suddenly. Letby: Well Baby C was tiny, obviously compromised in utero. Baby D septic. It\'s Baby A I can\'t get my head around That morning, one of the nurses asks how Letby is and if she had been working with Baby E - as well as his twin brother, Baby F. Letby: News travels fast. Who told you? Letby: Yeah I had them both. Was horrible. […] Nurse: I just really feel for his parents but for you too. You\'ve had some really tough times recently That night, before going back on shift, Letby exchanges texts with a colleague who commiserates, saying "you seem to be having some very bad luck". Letby: Not a lot i can do really. He had massive haemorrhage could have happened to any baby x Four days after attempting to kill Baby F, Letby messages a colleague: Letby: I said goodbye to Baby F\'s parents as Baby F might go tomorrow. They both cried & hugged me saying they will never be able to thank me for the love & care I gave to Baby F & for the precious memories I\'ve given them. It\'s heartbreaking Nurse: It is heartbreaking but you\'ve done your job to the highest standard with compassion and professionalism.[...] Letby: I just feel sad that they are thanking me when they have lost him & for something that any of us would have done. But it\'s really nice to know that I got it right for them. That\'s all I want. Letby receives a supportive text from a manager in the unit and her reply suggests she has been the subject of criticism or suspicion: The next day she messages one of the other nurses: Letby: It\'s all just so rubbish lately isn\'t it. And always seems to happen at night when less people Letby: This is what we do, as sad and as hard as it can be The next morning, Letby texts a colleague who is taking over, saying Baby I "deteriorated a lot this morning" and had to be resuscitated. In the afternoon, she messages the nurse who is acting as shift leader to ask if Baby I will be transferred. Letby: I\'d like to keep her please The shift leader agrees, but a little over an hour later she messages to say she had to reallocate. Letby asks if something happened. Shift leader: No. Was just asked to reallocate so no one has her for more than 1 night at a time. Baby I died the following week, when Letby was again on', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Letby murdered one of their baby boys, and tried to kill the other twin the following day. Letby has been found guilty of murdering seven babies, and trying to kill six others, at the Countess of Chester Hospital. There were six more attempted murder charges. She was found not guilty of two and the jury was undecided on the remaining four. To protect the identities of the babies and their parents, the twins are referred to as Baby E and Baby F. "We were actually told we would never have our own children," the babies\' mother says, speaking to BBC Panorama. She found out she was having twins on Valentine\'s Day, in 2015, after several failed IVF attempts. It had not been the plan to have the babies at the Countess of Chester Hospital, where Letby worked. It wasn\'t their nearest hospital, but when the time came that was where there was space. The twins were born prematurely, in the summer of 2015, and despite them needing specialist care in the neonatal unit, their father remembers the joy he felt as a new dad. "There was just a sheer elation and happiness that I\'d never felt before, or since," he says now. Warning: This article contains details some readers may find upsetting After the birth, the babies\' mother would come down from the maternity ward where she was recovering from a Caesarean section to drop off breast milk. Her babies, who lay side-by-side in incubators, were doing well and the family was waiting to be transferred to a hospital closer to home. But as she approached their room one evening, she could hear intense crying that sounded like screaming. "I\'ve never heard anything like it since," the mother says. "I was like, \'What\'s the matter with him?\'" "It was a sound that should not come from a tiny baby," she said while giving evidence at Letby\'s trial, in November. Walking into the room she discovered it was one of her babies - Baby E - making the noise. He had blood around his mouth. Rushing to comfort him, she gently put her hand on his tummy to give him a reassuring sign that she was there. She\'d been taught this in hospital - and normally it worked. But the baby continued screaming and she could feel her panic rising. Letby was the only other person in the room. The child\'s mother remembers she wasn\'t near her baby and didn\'t look at him while she was in there. "You know when it feels like somebody wants to look busy, but they\'re not actually doing anything?" she says now. She asked Letby what was wrong with her son. The nurse told her the baby\'s feeding tube must have been rubbing the back of his throat. She said she had already called a registrar, who would be there soon. Letby, an experienced nurse who the mother trusted, told her not to worry, to go back to her ward and that she\'d be contacted if there was a problem. "She has this really calm demeanour about her," the mother told the BBC. "She\'s very softly spoken." The parents had struck up a rapport with Letby - they were all on first name terms. They\'d shared their story with the neonatal staff; their journey to starting a family, and the obstacles they\'d faced. Letby had told them about her life. She was happy being single, she told them, and was hoping to buy a house. When the baby\'s condition deteriorated later on, his mother rushed back to the unit, where she watched through the glass as medics crowded around his incubator, attempting to resuscitate her son. She remembers Letby was there but didn\'t make eye contact with them. By the time the baby\'s father arrived, a priest had been called, and the parents were taken to be with their child. "We were told to talk to him, and hold his hand," says the mother, "and then he was christened." Eventually, the consultant told them there was nothing more that could be done. "She said: \'It\'s no good. We want him to die in your arms rather than being worked on\'," she says through tears. "And they passed him to us, and he died." The parents remember Letby looking visibly upset. The nurse then took control of the situation. "She bathed him and then she dressed him in a little woollen gown and gave him back to us," says the mother, "and we held him for a little bit longer." Doctors decided the cause of Baby E\'s death was a bowel condition, and that his premature birth was a factor. The death wasn\'t initially considered suspicious, so no post-mortem examination was carried out. In court, the mother said she had been "totally surprised" when Letby presented her and her husband with a memory box containing a lock of the baby\'s hair and his hand and footprints. Letby had also taken photos of him, without their knowledge, and presented those to the parents too. The mother said the nurse had given both twins a cuddly toy and later showed her a photo of her surviving baby, Baby F, holding his twin brother\'s teddy. "She said: \'He rolled over and hugged his bear - I thought it was so amazing I took a picture for you,\'" the mother remembers Letby saying. At the time, this anecdote was comforting to the parents. But soon they realised new born babies can\'t roll over - their neck and arm muscles aren\'t strong enough - and it became one of many disturbing things they now view very differently.

Results statement and text:  We were not able to confidently determine the gender of any of the additional sources quoted.
Gender is complex and not limited to "male" or "female". Furthermore, naming conventions vary by culture and individual preference, so it is not always possible to accurately determine the gender of a person by their name alone.
Nonetheless, it is always good to try to get diverse perspectives in your story.

Dr Ravi Jayaram, senior paediatrician at the Countess of Chester Hospital, said he and other doctors warned NHS managers of concerns about Letby months before police were called. He said executives ordered him to 'draw a line' under his worries and he was even told to apologise to Letby in a mediation meeting, ITV News reports. Dr Jayaram said: 'I do genuinely believe that there are four or five babies who could be going to school now who aren't.' Doctors were advised to apologise or face a possible referral to the general Medical Council. ITV News has seen a letter to Letby, which consultants allegedly wrote under duress: 'Dear Lucy, we would like to apologise for any inappropriate comments that may have been made during this difficult period. We are very sorry for the stress and upset that you have experienced in the last year. Please be reassured that patient safety has been our absolute priority during this difficult time.' Police were eventually contacted by the hospital trust nearly two years after the deaths of the first of the seven babies Letby was today found guilty of murdering. Following Letby's conviction of seven murders and six attempted murders today, which makes her the worst child killer in the UK's modern history, the government has ordered an independent inquiry into the circumstances behind the horrific murders. Medical Director Ian Harvey is said to have clamped down on doctors who raised suspicions, telling them via email that there was 'no smoking gun' as Letby was allowed to return to the ward. Dr Jayaram described how he was forced by managers to endure a mediation session with the killer nurse whom he still regarded as dangerous. He told ITV News: 'I've been a paediatrician since 1992 and I have never in my career seen anything like this.' He described how doctors initially felt relief that Letby was working when babies began crashing: 'Initially there was this feeling of thank goodness Lucy is on - she's good in a crisis.' He described the moment he realised there might be a killer on the unit as 'chilling'. Describing a meeting with the Chief Executive of the hospital, the experienced doctor said: 'The very first thing that Tony Chamber said to us... was 'I can see how that might be a very convenient explanation for things.' 'He'd already decided that wasn't going on and this was just us trying to cover up.' Both Baby O, a triplet, and his brother, Baby P, were murdered after the 'Gang of Four' consultants raised their suspicions about the link between the nurse's presence and the deaths they had already witnessed. The unit's lead consultant Stephen Brearey even went back to management in the hours after Baby P's death on June 24, 2016, begging them to take Letby off the ward. They refused. Once police were finally called, after consultants demanded to speak to management face-to-face, Dr Jayaram told ITV it was only then that concerns were taken seriously. During the course of their investigation officers discovered two baby boys, from separate sets of twins, had been 'deliberately' poisoned with insulin eight months apart. The results of their blood tests had been missed by doctors who had no idea there was a 'poisoner at work'. Speaking outside the hospital today, medical director Dr Nigel Scawn said: 'I speak for the whole trust when I say how deeply saddened and appalled we are at Lucy Letby's crimes. 'We are extremely sorry that these crimes were committed at our hospital and our thoughts continue to be with all the families and loved ones of the babies who came to harm or died. We cannot begin to understand what they have been through. 'This case has had a profound impact on our patients and our local community and also our staff, who come to work every day determined to provide safe and high quality care for all of our patients. 'Our staff are devastated by what has happened and we are committed to ensuring that lessons continue to be learned. 'We are grateful for the co-operation of our staff, especially those that have maintained the utmost professionalism while giving evidence in this trial.'

Police found nothing in her background or upbringing, or any event that may have triggered her killing spree which began in June 2015. Evidence that she became animated and excited after the babies’ deaths, enjoyed the drama of the emergencies when infants collapsed and was quick to tell her colleagues in texts when something unusual and tragic had happened on her shift, pointed to her revelling in the attention, they said. Letby was psychologically assessed and deemed fit to stand trial, but this desire to be at the centre of a crisis could be a symptom of the mental disorder Munchausen’s syndrome, one leading criminologist told the Mail. However, in the absence of a clear motive, Detective Superintendent Paul Hughes, who led the investigation for Cheshire Police, said he believed Letby’s ‘confession’ note provided the only explanation for why she became Britain’s most prolific child killer in modern times. ‘She clearly loves the attention, I think she loved the attention of a trial as well,’ DS Hughes said. ‘But if we are looking for why she’s done this, then to re-use her own words, “she is evil and she did this”. Without her telling us why, if we’re looking for why, then she wrote it down in that note.’ The green Post-it note was discovered in her diary when police searched her home after she was arrested in July 2018. It was headed: ‘NOT GOOD ENOUGH.’ As well as writing, ‘I AM EVIL, I DID THIS’ in capital letters, Letby also scrawled: ‘There are no words. I am an awful person – I pay every day for that. I can’t breathe. I can’t focus. Kill myself right now. Overwhelming fear/panic. I’ll never have children or marry. I’ll never know what it’s like to have a family. NO HOPE. ‘I haven’t done anything wrong. Police investigation forget slander. Discrimination. Victimisation. All getting too much everything taking over my life. Hate myself so much for what this has . . . I feel very alone and scared. What does the future hold. How can I get through it. How will things ever be like they used. HATE. PANIC. FEAR. LOST. I don’t deserve to live. I DID THIS. WHY ME. I killed them on purpose because I’m not good enough for them and I am a horrible evil person. I don’t deserve Mum and Dad. World is better off without me.’ Letby claimed the note was not a confession and that she wrote it after being moved off the unit, in July 2016, because she was struggling with being blamed for something she hadn’t done. But the prosecution urged the jury to read it ‘literally’ and Mr Hughes said it was his view that Letby deliberately left the note for police to find. He said that, by May 2017, she was aware police were investigating and, although she had a shredder at her home address in Chester, she did not destroy the note, nor did she get rid of other incriminating papers, nursing handover sheets and medical documents, which were found stashed under her bed. ‘In my view, she wrote it down and left it for us to find,’ Mr Hughes said. ‘She knew the police were investigating, she knew that she’d been moved and therefore was not a criminal suspect, but a community suspect. ‘She knew her colleagues had been spoken to by the police. ‘It was in the newspapers in May 2017 that Cheshire Police were investigating the circumstances around neonatal mortality. She knew at some point we would be speaking to her, so either recklessly or intentionally she wrote it down to be found.’ Mr Hughes said Letby was not stupid and speculated whether she left the notes because she wanted ‘notoriety’. Handwriting expert Adam Brand, who analysed Lucy Letby’s notes for the Mail, said her writing style was evidence of a ‘manipulative and dishonest’ individual. Other features of her writing indicated that she could also be ‘charming’ and ‘kind’. He said her style displayed traits of antisocial behaviour disorder – impulsiveness, dishonesty, rejection of discipline and manipulation – while it also showed she was capable of ‘integrating’ into society. He said the handwriting in Letby’s 2016 diary, which was recovered by police, was ordered and appeared to be done by someone in control. But it was in great contrast to the coloured notes, which were shown to the jury and appeared to be much more chaotic and disturbed. ‘Her writing shows she is a charming person who can do some terrible deeds,’ he said. He likened Letby to Jeffrey Dahmer, the US serial killer who murdered and dismembered 17 men in 13 years. ‘He has been described as an integrated anti-social and I see her like that,’ he said. ‘She is somebody who can occasionally be very friendly, other times manipulative, secretive and cold.’ Mr Brand highlighted several ‘disturbances’ in her handwriting, although it wasn’t part of the prosecution case. The way she had written HATE, PANIC, FEAR, LOST on the green note could be viewed as attention-seeking. It suggested she wanted to be listened to and not ignored, he said. The ‘continuous loopings’ on a yellow note showed she was obsessive. The way her writing does not slant one way or the other is highly unusual and suggests she suffered ‘horrific’ mood swings and had difficulty fitting into a team, said Mr Brand. The lack of consistency in the height of her letters also suggested she has self-esteem issues, while ‘hooks’ at the start of vowels was symbolic of evasiveness. Shaded boxes and grid doodles also signified repressed anger and that she felt trapped, he said. ‘She’s intelligent and articulate, she did well on her scores [as a nurse], she was good at what she did when she wanted to do it correctly,’ he added. ‘You could see that in the way she wrote her hospital records.

And as this devastating report shows, she was left to attack TEN more infants", 'byline': 'TOM RAWSTORNE', 'time': '2023-08-18T22:01:04+0100', 'text': "Early summer 2015 and a young mum-to-be was admitted to the Countess of Chester Hospital. She had nine weeks to go before her due date, but doctors were so worried by her high blood pressure, they decided to deliver her twins immediately by Caesarean section. The operation went smoothly enough, the boy weighing in at 3 lb 12 oz and his sister a fraction lighter. The girl was born blue and floppy and with a low heart rate, and was placed on a ventilator. Her brother breathed on his own and was more stable. Both were immediately moved to the hospital's neonatal unit, where they were placed side by side in incubators in Nursery One — reserved for the sickest of the new arrivals. 'Sometimes the smallest things take up the most room in your heart,' read a poster pinned to the wall in the corridor outside. It was something the mother and father of the babies, who for legal reasons we shall call Baby A and Baby B, already knew. They had dreamed of starting a family for years and now all they could do was hope for the best. Because it is hope that drives much of what goes on in a neonatal unit. Hope that babies born prematurely or born unwell will survive those vital first few hours. Hope that as the days pass, heart rates steady, tiny lungs strengthen and weight is put on. And hope that the doctors and nurses in whose hands the lives of their loved ones rest will do their very best for them. The hospital's neonatal unit was not untypical of those found in general hospitals up and down the country. At its core were the four treatment rooms where up to 16 babies could be cared for at any one time. Nursery One, known to nurses as The Hot Room, was the intensive-care unit, with one nurse assigned to each baby. Next door was the high-dependency unit, Nursery Two, where a nurse might be designated two babies to look after in their shift. Nursery Three and Nursery Four were used as 'growing' rooms for babies who needed to establish a good feeding regime before they could be discharged. As for the medical staff, at the top of the pyramid were the consultants, followed by the registrars and then the senior house officers. The nursing staff totalled about 25 nurses and 15 nursery nurses. They worked either day or night shifts or a combination of the two. The day shift started at 7.30am; nights at 7.30pm. Parents would visit during the day, meaning that at night there were significantly fewer people around. As for who cared for which baby, that was down to the shift leader, designating nurses to each tiny patient. And so it was that on June 8, 2015, as the day shift handed over to the night shift, a new nurse was designated to Baby A. The nurse's name was Lucy Letby. When she came on to the ward Baby A — the boy — was assessed as 'doing well'. Within an hour and a half, he was dead. Babies A and B: 'You need to let him go' Date of attacks: June 8 and 10, 2015 VERDICT: Guilty of murdering Baby A and attempting to murder Baby B The first sign that anything was wrong came at 8.20pm when Baby A — the boy and the stronger twin at birth — suddenly stopped breathing. Letby was the only nurse to witness his collapse, which occurred around the time she set up a drip to give him a glucose infusion. She called a doctor and staff frantically attempted to resuscitate the child. Baby A's parents, watching television in a side room, rushed in. 'Please don't let my baby die, please don't let my baby die,' Baby A's mother begged, sobbing uncontrollably. But after the baby failed to respond, the child's grandmother told her daughter: 'You need to let him go.' Heartbroken, she agreed, nodding to the medics to stop chest compressions. As his family were comforted in a side room, Letby took Baby A's hand and footprints, as well as a lock of his hair. The nurse, whose name badge was adorned with the image of a butterfly, said she thought it was a 'nice thing to do'. Meanwhile, medics, some tearful, struggled to understand what had happened. An immediate post-mortem examination failed to provide any answers. But what did strike them as unusual was a rash they had seen on the boy's skin — patches of pink and blue that came and went. They did not know it then, but that flitting rash would become a 'hallmark' of a number of the deaths. The cause? Air that Letby had injected into the bloodstream of her victims, it was claimed. In the case of Baby A, it had probably been administered through his drip. But Letby gave the impression that she was as devastated as her colleagues. Like most 25-year-olds, she was a regular phone and social media user. And in the hours after Baby A's death she searched Facebook multiple times for the name of his mother, and sent WhatsApp messages to a colleague saying she hoped her shift the following night would be 'more positive'. Naturally, after Baby A's death his parents became desperately worried about the wellbeing of his sister Baby B. They spent the day cuddling her, and only in the evening were they persuaded to go for a rest. 'The next thing I know we were getting woken up by a nurse,' the mother would tell the court. 'My heart sank,' she said. 'Not my baby. Not again.' This time, Letby was not caring for their daughter. But in the early hours of June 10, she did help the designated nurse start a bag of intravenous feed. At about 12.30am — 27 hours after Baby A had collapsed — an alarm monitoring Baby B activated and Letby called for help.

The distraught parents of the babies killed described their 'eight years of torture' after a jury convicted her of a horrifying hospital killing spree. But as Letby preyed on babies by injecting air into their bloodstreams or feeding tubes and poisoning them with insulin, causing them to collapse and die, she was sending disturbing messages that would ultimately play a key part of evidence against her. The 33-year-old killer messaged her colleagues after murdering little babies, feigning heartbreak and innocence. Other nurses often replied with sympathy and concern, although one or two did raise questions over the deaths with Letby. The shocking texts show how Letby would offer to work extra shifts on the neonatal intensive therapy unit - and how she reacted as suspicions grew over the spike in the deaths of babies. At the same time, she was pursuing a close relationship with one of the hospital doctors, a married man who she would message for reassurance and support. The callous killer even bragged about how any enquiry would have 'minimal' on her, so confidant was she that she would not be caught in a long chain of messages which would ultimately play a large role in her conviction. June 9, 2015 On June 8, Letby killed her first victim, Baby A. Returning to work after a trip away, she took over care of Baby A from fellow nurse Melanie Taylor. Within 90 minutes of her arriving on the ward, Baby A is pronounced dead. Baby A's twin remains on the ward. The day after murdering Baby A, Letby messages her colleagues to say that she does not want to return to the nursery and see the parents - who also had a twin on the unit, Baby B - who she attacked sometime before June 11. Ms Taylor sends a WhatsApp message to Letby: 'I hope you are OK, you were brilliant.' Texting colleagues, Letby writes: 'It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.' 'Just a big shock for us all. Hard coming in tonight & seeing the parents x x.' Continuing to message one of the nurses the day after the killing, she adds: 'I just don't know how I'm going to feel seeing parents. 'Dad was on floor crying Saying [sic] please don't take our baby away when I took him to the mortuary, it's just heartbreaking.' Letby then arrives for a night shift that evening. June 10, 2015 Letby attacks Baby B despite not being her designated nurse. Baby B deteriorates rapidly just 28 hours after her twin's death. After intervention, Baby B is saved and is now aged eight. June 11, 2015 Three days later she messages one of her managers on the ward, requesting to be put back in charge of care and work more shifts. 'From a confidence point of view I need to take an ITU baby soon X.' June 13, 2015 Letby becomes frustrated with her manager after demanding to be allowed back to work in intensive care. Letby: 'I just keep thinking about Mon [death of Baby A]. Feel like I need to be in [nursery] one to overcome it... to get the image out of my head. It probably sounds odd but that's how I feel.' Colleague: 'Well it's up to you but don't think it's going to help. It sounds very odd and I would be complete opposite. Can understand [shift leader] she's trying to look after you all.' Letby: 'Well that's how I feel, from when I've experienced it at the Women's I needed to go straight back and have a sick baby otherwise the image of the one you lost never goes. 'Don't expect people to understand but I know how I feel... Anyway forget it. I can only talk about it properly with those who knew him... I'll overcome it myself. You get some sleep x'. Colleague: That's a bit mean isn't it. Don't have to know him to understand we've all been there. Yep off to bed now x.' Letby: 'I don't mean it like that, just that only those who saw him know what image I have in my head X. Forget it. I'm obviously making more of it than I should.' 'Sleep well xx', The conversation ends at 11.09pm. Six minutes later, Baby C falls critically ill. June 14, 2015 Baby C dies after Letby fed air into his stomach. Letby texts her colleague: 'Sorry if I was off just wasn't a great start to the shift byt sadly it got worse. X' 'I was struggling to accept what happened to Baby A. Now we've lost Baby C overnight and it's all a bit much.X' Colleague: 'Hoping [you're] going to be ok. This isn't like you. Sending you biggest hugs. Xx' Letby: 'I Just keep seeing them both [Baby A and Baby C]. No one should have to see and do the things we do. It's heart-breaking. But it's not about me. We learn to deal with it. Thank you xxx' 'It's not about me or anyone else, it's these poor parents who have to walk away without their baby. There are no words, it's been awful.' June 21, 2015 Baby D dies. Letby waits until the following morning to get in touch with her colleagues. June 22, 2015 Letby: 'We lost Baby D.' Colleague: ' What!!!! But she was improving. What happened.' 'Wanna chat? I can't believe you were on again. You having such a tough time.' Later, Letby says: 'On a day to day basis it's an incredible job with so many positives. But then sometimes I think, how do such sick babies get through and others just die so suddenly and unexpectedly? Guess it's how it's meant to be. 'I think there is an element of fate involved.

Both Baby O, a triplet, and his brother, Baby P, were murdered after a so-called Gang of Four raised their suspicions about the link between the nurse\'s presence and the deaths they had already witnessed. And even when the lead consultant, Stephen Brearey, went back to management in the hours after Baby P\'s death on June 24, 2016, his request to have Letby taken off the neo-natal unit was turned down flat. Karen Rees, the duty executive in urgent care, is said to have insisted there was \'no evidence\' against Letby and said she would be \'happy\' to take responsibility if something happened. Shockingly, doctors were even told to apologise to Letby and stop making allegations against her. On October 23, consultants on the unit decided to flag their concerns to hospital chiefs. An email was sent about the spike in deaths to Nursing Director Alison Kelly and the link with Letby highlighted again, but Dr Ravi Jayaram said they were \'fobbed off\'. He said Letby was allowed to continue working after Mrs Kelly insisted: \'It\'s unlikely that anything is going on, we\'ll see what happens.\' Dr Brearey said in evidence: \'I explained what had happened and said I didn\'t want Nurse Letby to come back to work the following day or until this was investigated properly. Karen said no to that, and [that] there was no evidence. \'The crux of the conversation was that I then put to her, was she happy to take responsibility for this decision in view of the fact that myself and consultant colleagues would not be happy with Nurse Letby going to work the following day? \'She responded, yes, she would be happy\'. I said, \'\'Would you be happy if something happened to any of the babies the following day?\'\' She said, \'\'Yes\'\'. A former hospital employee told the Mail: \'Management didn\'t want to hear it, they didn\'t want the bad publicity. Eventually, the consultants forced their hand. They said to the medical director Ian Harvey, "If you don\'t go to the police, we will". There was a lot of dragging of feet. They were frustrated.\' Rather than halting Letby\'s killing spree, bosses instead told doctors to write and apologise to Letby and stop making allegations against her, the BBC revealed. When she was eventually moved, the nurse was sent to the risk and patient safety office - where she sat close to managers whose job it was to investigate her. Dr Susan Gilby took over as deputy chief executive a month after Letby\'s arrest, and was shocked at what she found. She said the trust\'s refusal to notify police appeared to stem largely from PR concerns. \'Protecting their reputation was a big factor in how people responded to the concerns raised,\' she said. Dr Gilby also said deaths had not been reported appropriately, meaning the high fatality rate could not be picked up by the wider NHS system. Meanwhile, Dr John Gibbs - a former senior clinician at the Countess of Chester Hospital - said he blamed hospital managers for causing delays to the police investigation. \'It made the job more difficult for the police investigating these alleged or suspected episodes of deliberate harm when they were doing it several years later,\' he told Channel 4 News. \'And all of us professional witnesses - doctors and nurses - were giving statements several years after the events. Now, we always keep medical and nursing notes - and we could refer to those to remind ourselves of what happened at the time. \'But as for who was doing what, when; who was standing where, when; who was last with the patient before they collapsed? Trying to remember that to give the information to the police as part of their investigation several years after the event was very difficult.\' Today, the parents of babies murdered and maimed by Letby described their \'eight years of torture\' after she was convicted of killing seven newborns. It came as more families were warned their children could be victims of the nurse, with police reviewing the care of 4,000 babies admitted to NHS wards where Letby had worked. The neo-natal nurse now replaces Myra Hindley and Ian Brady as the most prolific child killer in modern British history after a jury found her guilty of murdering seven premature babies and attempting to murder six more. Letby was found not guilty of two attempted murder charges, and the jury could not reach verdicts on six further counts of attempted murder. She will be sentenced on Monday. But the cowardly killer refused to return to the dock yesterday to hear the last of the guilty verdicts - with the judge admitting he has no power to make her to come up from the cells. Calls are growing for a new law to force criminals to appear at sentencing hearings and face their victims and victims\' families. In a statement read outside Manchester Crown Court today, the victims\' families said: \'We are quite simply stunned. \'To lose a baby is a heartbreaking experience that no parent should ever have to go through, but to lose a baby or to have a baby harmed in these particular circumstances is unimaginable. \'Over the past seven to eight years we have had to go through a long, torturous and emotional journey. \'From losing our precious newborns and grieving their loss, seeing our children who survived, some of whom are still suffering today, to being told years later that their death or collapse might be suspicious, nothing can prepare you for that news.\' Police are now reviewing the care of 4,000 babies Letby may have come into contact with during a spell at the Countess of Chester Hospital from January 2012 to the end of June 2016 and', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Grammar and syntax is often something that can be overlooked, that's why it is important to have an editor with keen mind for the smallest of details on your staff.

The twisted nurse, 33, has been found guilty of murdering seven babies on her neonatal ward, and the attempted murder of six others. Letby deliberately injected them with air, force-fed others milk and poisoned two with insulin. Our exclusive picture shows her with 16 friends in York in June 2015. The next day she began her year-long spree, striking in the first 90 minutes of her shift at the Countess of Chester Hospital. She’d agreed to cover it and said in her trial evidence: “It’s awful. I was not even supposed to be working that night.” The hen party visited several bars in York and ended at Vodka Revolution. They wore badges and the bride-to-be — a nurse at Letby’s hospital — was draped in a white sash. Carrying pink balloons, they posed for pictures at the train station and visited Lendal Bridge. But after returning to work a day later on Monday June 8 2015, Letby murdered her first victim. Baby A, who weighed 3lbs 12ozs when born 12 weeks early, died from an injection of air 24 hours after his birth. Letby then tried to murder his twin sister, Baby B 28 hours later. The girl’s alarm sounded on the neo-natal unit after her breathing equipment had been sabotaged. Following the tots’ collapses Letby made sinister searches for their parents on Facebook. Earlier tonight Cheshire Constabulary said it will review the care of 4,000 babies at two hospitals where Letby served from 2012 to 2016. Only cases which raised medical concerns will be investigated further, police said. Victims’ parents today said the hospital must share blame for failing to probe claims against Letby. The Government has ordered an independent inquiry.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The 33-year-old nurse was the only child of doting furniture salesman John, 78, and accounts clerk Susan, 63. She grew up in a quiet cul-de-sac in the picturesque cathedral city of Hereford, close to the England-Wales border. At the time of her first arrest in July 2018, neighbours of the couple told of their shock as police searched her childhood home just days after Letby and her parents returned from one of their regular holidays to Torquay. Describing Letby as “very career driven”, one said: “I truly can’t believe it. She was a delight. Her parents must be going through hell. “Her parents have been my neighbours for at least 25 years, so I watched Lucy grow up. Lucy lives away but visits them frequently as any good daughter would. They adored her.” She attended a local comprehensive school before moving on to study at Hereford Sixth Form College, where former pals described her as one of the “geeky girls” who was part of a self-styled group known as the “miss-match family”. Always dreaming of becoming a nurse and the first in her family to go to university, she went on to study at Chester 100 miles away, where pals said she was always first home on a night out. One fellow student remembered Letby as part of a group who “weren’t girly girls who always \xadpartied, but were all very focused on their studies and loved it”. They described the Ellie Goulding fan as awkward and geeky but “kind-hearted”. One said: “She was very bright. She was really sweet, kind and friendly and always part of the quiet bunch. “I was so shocked when she was arrested because it’s not like her. “She loved her job, and when she and her friends were in uni they all worked so hard and were all driven and excited.” Letby graduated with a BSc Hons in child nursing in 2011 and went on to buy a £180,000 three-bedroom semi in Blacon, Chester, a mile from the hospital she worked at. She lived alone with her two cats Smudge and Tigger, and neighbours recalled how she lived there quietly. She is believed to have previously dated a male nurse, who is now married with children, but did not have a boyfriend during the period she harmed babies. Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Evans, of Cheshire Police, oversaw the team who interviewed Letby on three occasions. She described the nurse’s character as “beige”, adding: “There isn’t anything kind of outstanding or outrageous that we found about her as a person. “She was a normal 20-something- year-old doing what she was doing — her career and with her friends. But clearly, there was another side that nobody saw, and we have unravelled that.” Letby started working at the hospital in January 2012 as a Band Five nurse and went on to earn around £32,000 a year after being promoted to Band Six. In a 2013 interview with a local paper, she was pictured holding a babygrow as she proudly beamed: “I have been working on the unit since graduating. “I also worked on the unit as a student nurse during my three years of training. My role involves caring for a wide range of babies requiring various levels of support. Some are here for a few days, \xadothers for months and I enjoy seeing them progress and supporting their families.” Letby, who cared for hundreds of babies, helped with a fundraising campaign for a new £3million baby unit and colleagues described her as a “champion for children”. She was also undergoing intensive care training and had completed two placements at Liverpool Women’s Hospital in 2012 and 2015. Reflecting her passion for the job, she “liked” Channel 4 maternity unit show One Born Every Minute on Facebook and was a member of 14 groups aimed at helping sick kids. She told one colleague she enjoyed watching BBC2 series An Hour To Save Your Life, about a neonatal unit, adding: “I just find it interesting to see how our work is portrayed to the public.” After her 2011 graduation, her mum and dad — who stoically attended almost every day of the ten-month trial — put an announcement in a local paper. It said: “We are so proud of you after all your hard work. Love Mum and Dad.” Two years later, Letby was pictured smiling and holding up a baby garment in the hospital’s internal newsletter. Speaking about her job in the neonatal unit, echoing her newspaper comments, she again said: “My role involves caring for a wide range of babies . . . I enjoy seeing them progress and supporting their families.” Despite living and working away from home, Letby remained close with her parents, who kept her room for her to come back to. Following her arrest, the property was searched by police. Her trial heard she had a “mini-meltdown” following the deaths of three babies and messaged a colleague in June 2015: “I just need some time with Mum and Dad.” And after another baby suffered a collapse, she messaged a colleague who was moving to New Zealand. Letby wrote: “Not brave enough to up and leave. I couldn’t leave my parents. They would be completely devastated. Find it hard enough being away from me now and it’s only 100 miles.” Her colleague asked: “Where they based?” Letby responded: “Hereford. I came here to uni and didn’t go back. They hate it and I feel very guilty for staying here sometimes.” Her parents would visit Torquay three times a year and their daughter would regularly join them. They had just returned from one break when Letby’s house was first raided by police on July 3, 2018. A loud knock at the door was heard at 6am before officers filed in, telling the nurse she was being arrested on suspicion', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

One father told The Sun simply: “I’m blaming the hospital”. His twin boys — named only as Baby L and Baby M — miraculously survived Lucy Letby’s attempts to kill them. Baby L still suffers from night sweats after being poisoned with insulin on April 9, 2016. On the same day, Letby is believed to have either injected Baby M with air or obstructed his airway, leaving the infant with brain damage. The dad said: “Whatever sentence she gets is not going to be enough. "It’s going to be justice, but it’s not going to be enough. "She took everything — our joy, happiness, everything.” He and his wife recalled feeling “over the moon” at having two healthy twins as their firstborns. Nurse Letby had been present at their birth. Baby M later collapsed. Letby was present again as staff treated him. The mum said: “She was just standing there, very calm and cool. "At the time I didn’t know her name. I only found out later. “I was just praying to my god, asking what had happened to my child. "I’ve not done anything wrong in my life to anybody, so why do I have to suffer? "And then after 30 minutes he recovered.” Letby appeared “more aggressive” towards them. The mum said: “I think she was very annoyed with us because she didn’t succeed in killing our babies. "She was very frustrated.” And the parents said they are angry with Letby for “lying, lying, lying” every time she gave evidence They have told the twins, now seven, that they were targeted by Letby rather than let them find out from someone else. The mum, a part-time carer, said: “They make a joke of it. "They say, ‘We’ll kick her, we’ll bite her, we’ll pull her hair, Mummy.’ "But they don’t understand yet.” Their grandfather never got to see Letby convicted, dying last month — “always asking” about the trial. It emerged during the ten-month trial that red flags were reported to bosses at The Countess of Chester Hospital just a month after Letby started her year-long killing spree. There was proof Baby L had been poisoned with manufactured insulin, but the parents were not told. The mum added: “As soon as two or three babies died . . . why did they wait until 17 babies were attacked?” The couple are now demanding a public inquiry and said, in particular, then director of nursing Alison Kelly had questions to answer. They are also concerned that the registrar Letby was in love with had forwarded her a confidential email about a review into the deaths of two triplets. The mum said: “It’s surely a definite breach that needs to be investigated.” The mum and dad have become close to the parents of Baby F, left severely disabled while twin, Baby E, was one of the seven to die. That couple branded Letby a “hateful human being”. The mother remembered the harrowing moments when she walked into a room to find Letby with Baby E who had blood around his mouth. She said Letby had a “really calm demeanour about her” as she stood at the other side of the room while the mother frantically comforted her dying child. She told the BBC: “You know when it feels like somebody wants to look busy, but they’re not actually doing anything?” As the baby’s condition worsened, the heartbroken mum had to watch through glass as medics tried in vain to resuscitate him. After the baby died, cold-blooded Letby handed his lifeless body to the distraught parents. The mum said: “She bathed him and then she dressed him in a little woollen gown and gave him back to us, and we held him for a little bit longer.” Letby had presented the parents with a memory box containing a lock of the baby’s hair, prints of his hand and foot, plus pictures she had secretly taken of him. She even shared a picture of Baby F, rolled over and hugging his brother’s toy bear. However, what they thought was a sweet gesture took a chilling twist when they learned that \xadnewborns cannot roll on to their fronts unaided. Initially no post-mortem was carried out. But experts have since ruled his death was a result of internal bleeding and an injection of air into his bloodstream. Baby F had suddenly become \xadcritically ill within 24 hours of his brother’s death. The mother, who remained by his cot all night, recalled: “I said to my husband, ‘Please, not again — we can’t do this again, this can’t be happening.’ ” Medics managed to save him. Two years later his parents learned his intravenous feedbag had been poisoned with insulin. He has been left with “a lot of complex needs”. The parents, who had struggled to conceive, told how they had struck up a friendship with Letby, often sharing stories about their personal lives. The mum said: “Never in a million years did I think it would be someone that we felt we had a \xadconnection with. “I think she\'s a hateful human being. "What she’s done has changed the course of our life forever.”', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The nurse, 33, who was today found guilty of murdering seven babies, was said to have formed an obsession with the male doctor, scrawling notes in her bedroom saying: “I loved you.” When cops arrested her for the first time in July 2018, they found the messages strewn around her home and even hidden inside her diary. Letby, who lived alone with her cats at her semi-detached property in Chester, Cheshire, wrote: “Please help me, please help me (doctor’s name). I trusted you with everything. (Doctor’s name) I loved you.” In another she said: “(Doctor’s name), my best friend.” Next to the doctor\'s name, she had scrawled: “I can’t do this anymore.” Letby had been accused of “flirting” with the medic, who cannot be named for legal reasons, by a nursing colleague while working on the unit, her trial heard. The only time Letby showed emotion was when the doctor spoke in the courtroom. The medic was behind a screen to protect his identity, but the killer nurse was said to have broken down in tears and abruptly left her seat when she heard his voice. She swapped multiple Facebook messages with him on the same day Baby O died, before murdering his triplet brother 24 hours later. During her trial, prosecutor Mr Nick Johnson KC: “Did you want to get his attention?” Letby: “No”. The barrister pressed again: “Is that the reason you sabotaged Baby O?” Letby replied: “No.” On June 23, 2016, her first shift back after her holiday to Ibiza, she sent him: “Boo.” He said he would be returning to the neonatal ward later that day and offered to bring her some lunch. Giving evidence on the last of her 14 days in the witness box, the nurse hesitated when asked to read out a message exchange with him. Mr Johnson had to prompt her twice before she finally referred to an emoji the male doctor, who cannot be named for legal reasons, sent her. Letby said: “It’s a heart.” She had responded to the doctor’s love heart with one of her own, combined with a smiling face emoji. The court heard how on one occasion Letby went to London with the married doctor and had been due to go a second time before the trip was cancelled. She also met up with him several times after she’d been pulled from the unit pending an investigation. In 2017 the pair enjoyed a day out at the Cheshire Oaks designer outlet and also went for coffee at Starbucks. A note, found at the hospital’s patient safety office, bore further references to the doctor. It referred to “Tigger and Smudge” and then his name. It comes as... Another said: “I loved you but it wasn’t enough.” Giving evidence, Letby denied any romantic involvement but admitted: “Sometimes he would come to my house, sometimes we would go out for meals or walks." And she even broke down in tears for the first time the moment he gave evidence. The nurse’s emotional outburst came 16 weeks into her trial at Manchester crown court. It happened as soon as he began to speak from behind a screen. Letby was seen wiping tears from her eyes with tissues from a box beside her. She stood up in the dock and was led to the cells as she needed a few minutes to compose herself. The doctor’s evidence related to Baby L, one of a set of twins who Letby is alleged to have injected with insulin. The only other time Letby broke down in tears was in April when the jury were shown pictures of her bedroom. In one message exchange, the pair joked about reporting in sick so they could go home. Mr Johnson put it to Letby that a nurse pal accused her of being “sweet” on the doctor in a series of WhatsApp messages in June 2016. Do you know Lucy Letby? Call The Sun on 0207 782 4368 or email exclusive@the-sun.co.uk There was a long pause before Letby replied at Manchester crown court: “There was nothing between me and the doctor.” The barrister pressed her, asking: “Did she think you were sweet on him? Letby asked: “What do you mean?” Mr Johnson replied: “Had a crush on him.” She responded “no”. In one exchange, her pal suggested alongside a laughing emoji that the doctor would like her to "go commando". Letby replied with four laughing emojis but told her murder trial she didn’t know what the phrase meant. Child A, allegation of murder. The Crown said Letby injected air intravenously into the bloodstream of the baby boy. COUNT 1 GUILTY. Child B, allegation of attempted murder. The Crown said Letby attempted to murder the baby girl, the twin sister of Child A, by injecting air into her bloodstream. COUNT 2 GUILTY. Child C, allegation of murder. Prosecutors said Letby forced air down a feeding tube and into the stomach of the baby boy. COUNT 3 GUILTY. Child D, allegation of murder. The Crown said air was injected intravenously into the baby girl. COUNT 4 GUILTY. Child E, allegation of murder. The Crown said Letby murdered the twin baby boy with an injection of air into the bloodstream and also deliberately caused bleeding to the infant. COUNT 5 GUILTY. Child F, allegation of attempted murder. Letby was said by prosecutors to have poisoned the twin brother of Child E with insulin. COUNT 6 GUILTY. Child G, three allegations of attempted murder. The Crown said Letby targeted the baby girl by overfeeding her with milk and pushing air down her feeding tube. COUNT 7 GUILTY, COUNT 8 GUILTY, COUNT 9 NOT GUILTY. Child H, two allegations of attempted murder. Prosecutors said Letby sabotaged the care of the baby girl in some way which led to two profound oxygen desaturations.

So far officers have looked into only her killings between June 2015 and June 2016 at The Countess of Chester Hospital, Cheshire. As Letby faces life behind bars, they are continuing their investigation — dating it back to 2012 when she started at the Countess. But they are also investigating Liverpool Women’s Hospital where she worked on placements in 2012 and 2015. In that time about 4,000 babies would have passed through the hospitals’ maternity wards. Police are confident the 33-year-old has not killed any other children but believe she may have harmed or tried to harm one. Officers are reviewing thousands of medical files and some parents have already either come forward with suspicions or been contacted by police. Others have already had specialist family liaison officers assigned to them. Det Supt Paul Hughes, of Cheshire Police, said: “There’s a lot of years to go through, a massive amount of medical records, so it would just be unfair to speculate. “We are committed to a thorough investigation across the entire footprint. “We are committed to investigating all of the times that Lucy Letby has been employed as a nurse and has had access to neonatal units.” It is likely senior officers will visit Letby to see if she will admit other crimes. Det Chief Insp Nicola Evans said: “We’ve set up our own reception team so that if anybody does have concerns about their own child, wherever that hospital may be, if they contact Cheshire Police they will be put through. “They’ll speak to an investigator on this inquiry, and hopefully that means they will receive some answers pretty quickly.” The six-year investigation has already cost millions but the force said money would not be a barrier to uncovering all Letby’s crimes.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Article data found: {'link': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-66553245', 'title': 'Lucy Letby: Families of victims call for greater powers in inquiry', 'byline': 'By James Gregory & Oliver Slow', 'time': '2023-08-19T16:39:17.000Z', 'text': 'Families of some of the babies attacked by Lucy Letby have said the inquiry into the case should have powers to compel witnesses to come forward. An independent inquiry was ordered on Friday after the nurse\'s conviction for the crimes at a hospital in Chester. But lawyers for two of the families said this inquiry does not go far enough and needs to be statutory to have "real teeth". The government said the inquiry aimed to ensure lessons were learned. Letby was found guilty of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder six others at the Countess of Chester Hospital between 2015-16, following a 10-month trial. She was found not guilty on two attempted murders and the jury could not reach verdicts on six others. She will be sentenced on Monday. Separately an inquiry will now look into the circumstances surrounding the events leading up to the murders and attempted murders of the babies by the neonatal nurse. The announcement of the non-statutory inquiry has divided opinion on how effective it will be in examining the case. Slater and Gordon, the law firm representing two of the families, said a non-statutory inquiry "is not good enough" and lessons had to be learned by the hospital, NHS and wider medical profession. "As a non-statutory inquiry, it does not have the power to compel witnesses to provide evidence or production of documents and must rely on the goodwill of those involved to share their testimony," the firm said in a statement. Labour\'s City of Chester MP Samantha Dixon told the BBC a judge should lead the inquiry, also highlighting how that as it stood the inquiry would rely on "the goodwill of witnesses to attend". In contrast Conservative MP, Dr Caroline Johnson, said she agreed with the current approach. Dr Johnson, a consultant paediatrician and MP who sits on the health select committee, said lessons needed to be learned quickly and the government could decide to order a statutory inquiry at a later date if extra powers were needed. "I appreciate that people can\'t be compelled in quite the same way, I would hope that people would still nevertheless come forward," she told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme. Dr Bill Kirkup, who has led non-statutory reviews for other maternity units, said non-compliance had not been a problem in his experience and people were "ready and willing to cooperate". The patient safety investigator told the BBC he had identified common features between the Letby case and the reviews he had conducted - including managers accused of "protecting reputations" above listening to staff concerns. After the verdict, Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said it was "extremely sorry" the crimes happened in its hospital and it had since made "significant changes" to their services. Former chief executive of the hospital Tony Chambers and former medical director Ian Harvey, who were in charge at the time Letby was working at the hospital, have said they will co-operate fully with the inquiry. If you, or someone you know, have been affected by the issues raised here, there are details of organisations that may be able to offer support on the BBC Action Line.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}
Article data found: {'link': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-66553970', 'title': 'Lucy Letby: Hospital bosses were misled, former chair claims', 'byline': 'By Michael Buchanan', 'time': '2023-08-19T18:14:47.000Z', 'text': 'The former chair of the NHS trust where serial killer Lucy Letby worked believes the board was "misled" by hospital executives. The nurse was convicted on Friday of murdering seven babies and trying to murder another six at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Sir Duncan Nichol, who was the board\'s chair, said it was told there was "no criminal activity pointing to any one individual" despite concerns. A public inquiry has been ordered. Letby targeted the babies between June 2015 and June 2016, when they were dying or suddenly collapsing at five times the average annual rate at the hospital\'s neonatal unit. However the board was not alerted to the problems until July 2016, by which time 13 babies had died. At a meeting, the board then agreed to ask for the deaths to be externally investigated. The trust initially turned to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, who conducted a review of the unit but told the hospital executives they should conduct a separate "thorough external independent review of each unexpected neonatal death". Ian Harvey, who was then medical director at the hospital, contacted London-based neonatologist Dr Jane Hawdon. The doctor, who specialises in the care of newborns, did a brief review of each baby\'s medical notes. However she told the trust she did not have the time to conduct the thorough investigation the Royal College had recommended. It is understood Dr Hawdon did not speak directly to the board but sent her report and it was up to executives to brief the board on its findings. In a statement to the BBC, Sir Duncan said: "I believe that the board was misled in December 2016 when it received a report on the outcome of the external, independent case reviews. "We were told explicitly that there was no criminal activity pointing to any one individual, when in truth the investigating neonatologist had stated that she had not had the time to complete the necessary in-depth case reviews." In response to Sir Duncan\'s statement, the hospital\'s then chief executive Tony Chambers - who went on to lead three other NHS trusts on an interim basis after leaving Chester in 2018 - said that "what was shared with the board was honest and open and represented our best understanding of the outcome of the reviews at the time". In a BBC interview, Dr Susan Gilby - another former chief executive at the hospital - said she also had concerns the board may have been misled. When she joined the trust shortly after Letby\'s arrest in 2018, she examined internal information about the nurse\'s actions. "The documents that I have seen from the neonatologist [Dr Hawdon] and the briefing and the papers that were presented to the board are diametrically opposed. "It\'s hard to understand - unless there is something that I haven\'t seen - how the board were led to believe that a comprehensive review had taken place." Mr Harvey, who was medical director at the hospital trust until 2018, said: "The statements I gave to the board were true to the best of my knowledge." Three years ago, Sir Duncan, who stepped down in 2019, and Dr Gilby commissioned an external review by the health consultancy Facere Melius into how the hospital trust had handled the allegations. It has not been published. Both have welcomed the public inquiry into the events at the trust and said they would cooperate. Paediatric consultants who raised concerns about Letby\'s conduct have recently told the BBC of being bullied, ignored and forced to send her a letter of apology.

Fifteen children were among 144 people wounded, the police said. At least 25 people were in hospital. Among the victims were people who had been celebrating an Orthodox Christian holiday at church, the ministry said. A main square and a university building were also damaged in the attack. The UN called it "heinous". Chernihiv is located around 50km (31 miles) from the border with Belarus. It was besieged by Russia at the beginning of the invasion. The city\'s imposing theatre was hit directly. Tiles were blown off the roofs of neighbouring buildings with one catching fire 100 metres away. The theatre was hosting a gathering of drone manufacturers, the acting mayor of Chernihiv told the BBC. "I understand that their aim was a military event taking place in the building of the drama theatre and that it was their target," Oleksandr Lomako said. "But it is clear that the Russians launching those missiles and those giving them orders in the middle of the day to the civilian city realised that the victims will be primarily civilians. "There is no other way to interpret it than a war crime against civilians, yet another Russian war crime," he added. The city centre of Chernihiv is a popular area for people to stroll around, especially on the weekend, locals told the BBC. Anna Zahreba, the manager of a Crimean Tatar restaurant just across the street from the theatre, said her staff were getting ready for a busy day when the missile hit. "I ran outside to see what was going on," she said. "There were two 12-year-old girls here and a lot of blood. One had her leg badly wounded. Another girl was screaming. "We applied a tourniquet and waited for an ambulance. It was taking a long time to get here, but some man stopped his car and we took a girl to a hospital." Anna says staff rushed to help injured people with medical kit and blankets. "There are always many people walking around here, with children and baby strollers. Many restaurants and cafes in the area," she tells us. "We did not expect a day like this." Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had turned an "ordinary Saturday" into "a day of pain and loss". The UN said it was "extremely disturbed" by the attack. "It is heinous to attack the main square of a large city, in the morning, while people are out walking, some going to the church to celebrate a religious day for many Ukrainians," Denise Brown, the current head of the UN in Ukraine, said in a statement. "Attacks directed against civilians or civilian objects are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law," she said. "It must stop." Three days of mourning have been announced in the city. Moscow is yet to comment. Elsewhere, Russia has claimed that a Ukrainian drone hit a military airfield in the northwest Novgorod region, causing a fire that was quickly put out. One plane was damaged but no casualties have been reported, it added. Ukraine has not commented on the alleged drone attack. Meanwhile, Kyiv\'s air force said the Ukrainian military had shot down 15 out of 17 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Moscow in an overnight strike.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

And King Charles III later urged the Lionesses to "roar to victory". In his separate video message with Princess Charlotte, Prince William said they were "so proud" of the Lionesses. As president of the Football Association, he has been criticised by some for not attending Sunday\'s final against Spain in Sydney. In the message posted on social media, alongside a smiling Princess Charlotte holding a football, Prince William said: "Lionesses, I want to send you a huge good luck for tomorrow, we\'re sorry we can\'t be there in person but we\'re so proud of everything you\'ve achieved and the millions you\'ve inspired here and around the world. "So go out there tomorrow and really enjoy yourselves." Princess Charlotte - who recorded a similar video message with her father ahead of the 2022 European Championships final - ended the video by saying: "Good luck Lionesses." And later the King posted an image of a lioness on social media accompanied by the message "Good luck today Lionesses, and may you roar to victory!". The King and Queen Camilla are expected to watch the game on television. "Both their majesties will be following Sunday\'s events with great interest," a Buckingham Palace source said. If England win when they take on Spain at 11:00 BST on Sunday they would become the first England football team to win a World Cup since 1966. No British royals will be present at the final. Prime minister Rishi Sunak will also not be attending. In a video message posted on social media on Saturday, he said the Lionesses "have inspired us with your skill, teamwork and courage" and "defied the odds, faced down the doubters and paved the way". Mr Sunak continued: "For my daughters, and every girl in this country, you have made football something for them. You have made them feel they belong on that pitch. "So in a way, you have already brought football home. All that remains is to bring the trophy home too and the whole nation is rooting for you." Prince William and the prime minister have both been criticised by sports broadcaster Gabby Logan for not attending the final in person. "I have to say I\'m disappointed that Prince William isn\'t going with his role at the FA and the history that is going to happen and be created on Sunday, one way or the other, she told the BBC\'s Newscast podcast. She added that she thought the pair would attend if the men\'s team had made the final. Former culture minister Lord Vaizey has also already called on them to fly to Sydney, saying it would be "unthinkable for them to miss a men\'s final". Downing Street has also previously said there are "no plans" for an extra bank holiday if England lift the trophy. A government spokesperson said: "Winning the World Cup would be a massive moment for the country and make no mistake we\'ll find the right way to celebrate. "As Sarina Wiegman herself has said, the first thing to do is focus on the final and the whole country will be rooting for the Lionesses this weekend". Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for a bank holiday if England make history by winning the tournament. Foreign Secretary James Cleverley and Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer will attend the final on behalf of the UK government. Queen Letizia of Spain is due to be there to cheer on England\'s opponents. England secured their place in the final by beating co-hosts Australia 3-1 on Wednesday. In a statement issued after the match, the King - who is head of state of both the UK and Australia - paid tribute to both sides. He said: "While your victory may have cost the magnificent Matildas their chance for the greatest prize in the game, both teams have been an inspiration on and off the pitch - and for that, both nations are united in pride, admiration and respect." The Women\'s World Cup final between England and Spain on Sunday will be shown live on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website from 10am. BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds will have radio commentary as both sides aim to win their first World Cup. The BBC Sport website and app will provide live text commentary.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) mistakenly released details on 10,000 of its employees in response to a Freedom of Information (FoI) request. The man was also charged with having articles for use in terrorism and is due in court in Coleraine on Monday. The FoI details were published online after being released by the PSNI. They were taken down from a website at the PSNI\'s direction a short time later. Police have confirmed the list is in the hands of dissident republicans, amongst others. It was one of three separate PSNI data breach incidents being examined by police. On 6 July, in an unrelated incident, a police-issue laptop and radio, as well as a document containing the names of more than 200 staff, were stolen from a private vehicle in Newtownabbey, County Antrim. In another incident, on Thursday 17 August, a PSNI laptop and a police officer\'s notebook fell from the roof of a moving car on the M2 in Belfast. It happened on the Foreshore stretch of the motorway in the north of the city. The PSNI confirmed that this notebook contained details of 42 officers and staff and sections of the book still have not been found. They said the laptop that fell off the vehicle on the M2 was recovered and "immediately deactivated". On Friday, a police spokesperson said the PSNI would be contacting the Information Commissioner about the M2 incident. They added that Stormont\'s Department of Justice and the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which holds the PSNI to account, had already been informed about the breach.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Title: Head of Department
Company/location: WaSH (based in Dnipro)
About: It is apparent, I now have an average ‘shelf life’ somewhere between 6 to 12 months. Occasionally, I might achieve an extension beyond the 12 when the nature of my contract, or perhaps location changes significantly but that seems the exception to the rule. I am perfectly Ok with this, since my strengths lie in the formulation of new strategies, devising new ways of working, improving efficiencies, promoting better outcomes and giving confidence to local people and colleagues; taking control of their own destinies. I am no longer interested in carving out some stellar career path of my own and climbing back up to the top of the greasy pole! I ran my own company in Ethiopia for 10 years, enjoyed that kind of success and was happy to let it all go in 2015 for a simpler life, exploring new and exciting challenges.I have a creative mind and can easily see the big picture.

Andrew Sean Ryan, MPH
Title: Field Site Coordinator—Chernihiv | Ukraine Emergency Response
Company/location: International Medical Corps
About: I’m a natural problem solver and a driven serial entrepreneur with a passion for leading and growing early-stage ventures. I spend my time thinking about, and building solutions, to big problems. When I'm not thinking about solutions to the big problems in my mind, I like to help others solve the problems that have their attention. These are the things that make me happy. As a founder of multiple organizations and as a person whose identity is rooted in service to others, my career has taken me from winning international social innovation awards; to the front lines of disaster relief in New Orleans and Haiti; and currently to Germany where I serve in a leadership role for a health supplement startup. All of these experiences have culminated in one special privilege which continues to be a great honor: many early-stage founders in my extended network seek my feedback and advice in order to move their ideas from paper to reality.

Gender is complex and not limited to "male" or "female". Furthermore, naming conventions vary by culture and individual preference, so it is not always possible to accurately determine the gender of a person by their name alone.

The pop sensation, 41, is divorcing Asghari after just a year of marriage and was pictured late Friday night, just two days after her split was announced, at Dave's Hot Chicken in Oxnard, California. She emerged from the restaurant with a raspberry lemonade drink in hand alongside her security team at midnight amid reports her divorce is getting ugly. It came just after Britney, who has a reported net worth of $60M, broke her silence over the split for the first time, admitting she was 'a little shocked.' The newly single singer looked downcast and wore her blonde hair down with a touch of makeup on her face. She appeared to be going bra-less in an off-the-shoulder sweater, black jeans, and sandals. In her latest Instagram post, she wrote in a video of her dancing around her living room: 'I couldn't take the pain anymore honestly!!! In some sort of telepathic way, I have been receiving so many messages that melt my heart from friends and I thank you!!!' She continued: 'I've been playing it strong for way too long and my Instagram may seem perfect but it's far from reality and I think we all know that!!!' The mother-of-two went on to admit that she 'would love to show' her 'emotions and tears' online, but always feels the need to 'hide' her 'weaknesses.' 'If I wasn't my dad's strong soldier, I would be sent away to places to get fixed by doctors!!!' she admitted. 'But that's when I needed family the most!!!' While appearing to stay optimistic, the Grammy winner reminded fans that 'you're supposed to be loved unconditionally' and that she's going to be 'as strong as' she can. 'And I'm actually doing pretty d**n good!!! Anyways have a good day and don't forget to smile!!!' she concluded. In the footage, uploaded to her account on Friday night, the performer appeared in high spirits as she smiled and twirled around in a tiny black crop top and a pair of low-rise neon green bikini bottoms. Over the years, the star has talked about how sharing videos of herself dancing has been a source of 'healing' after being freed from her conservatorship. Last year, she told her followers that she 'recorded 30 videos of' dancing on vacation in Maui. 'That's fun to me!!!' she explained. I know I'm not the best dancer, a lot of people make fun of the way I move but honestly as long as I'm moving and expressing my body outwardly in someway at this point … that's healing to me!!!' she added. On Saturday, TMZ reported that Britney and Sam have ceased all communication with one another and are no longer living in the same house. According to insiders, their relationship turned 'really nasty' after Sam departed the residence and they haven't communicated with one another since his exit. The estranged couple have now left all communication up to their legal teams, who have been handling any negotiations and other issues for the pair. Britney's latest post comes after claims that she got physical with Sam several times during their relationship and, once, allegedly gave him a black eye as he slept. Asghari reportedly told friends that the pop princess would attack him during their seven years together, sources told TMZ, adding there were numerous fights where security had to step in between the pair. She has yet to address the allegations. Britney's camp has not responded to these claims, which DailyMail.com has reached out to on several occasions. Her latest update comes after DailyMail.com learned that she is refusing to let ex claim custody of their two dogs in their bitter divorce battle. In Asghari's divorce filing, he is requesting that the singer be made to pay spousal support, and cover his legal fees and court costs, while also asking for 'separate assets' and 'various items' - which Britney fears could include the two adopted dogs he gave her, a source close to the popstar has now revealed. Speaking exclusively to DailyMail.com, the Spears family insider revealed that Britney, who has hired the famously ferocious Hollywood divorce attorney Laura Wasser, is confident that her team will be able to shut down any claim Sam might make to her wealth - but she is gravely concerned that her beloved pups could be at greater risk. The former currently share two dogs: a Doberman named Porsha, which Sam gave to Britney in 2021, and a German Shepherd called Sawyer, which they adopted this year. 'Regarding [Britney and Sam's shared] property, the most difficult part of dividing any assets will be their two dogs,' the source explained. 'But Sam gave Porsha to Britney as a present and she was the one who wanted to adopt Sawyer when they were in Maui.' However, the source added that there is one 'asset' that Britney is more than ready to hand back to her estranged spouse: her engagement ring, which the actor got for free. When Sam proposed to Britney in September 2021, he did so with a diamond sparkler designed by jeweler Roman Malayev - which he got for free, no doubt in the hopes that his wife's global fame would help to stir up publicity for the brand. But the rock has now lost it's sparkle for Britney, with the source telling DailyMail.com: 'Sam can have that ring. It was free from the jeweler and she doesn't want it anymore. She has enough diamonds.' As for Britney's current state, the insider revealed that she is being cared for by a team of friends, family members, and employees, a Maltese named Lulu and cat named Wendy - in addition to the beloved pups she got during her relationship. 'She is not alone at all. Britney has her sister Jamie Lynn who is in and out of LA and she also has her mom Lynne, who is expected", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

His father Richard, 89, and mother Anne, 82, were pulled from the vehicle after it veered off their access road and went into a river on the farm, but they sadly could not be saved. Channel 4 property show co-host Kirstie Allsopp paid tribute to the parents of her close friend Phil, 53, and said it was a 'great source of solace' to him that they were together as they passed away, The Sun reports. Richard and Anne were reportedly leaving their farm to travel to a local pub for lunch on Friday when their car drifted into a shallow river, which is a tributary which flows through the family farm in Littlebourne, near Canterbury, Kent. The fire service and police officers were called to the scene and an air ambulance also flew to the farm. Richard and Anne were pulled from the car and taken to hospital, but he was pronounced dead at the scene and she died shortly afterwards. Another woman, in her 60s, was also in the car but suffered only minor injuries. Phil, 53, spent last night with his younger sisters Caryn and Helen and his older brother David. A neighbour, who has lived next to the Spencer farm for 20 years, told the Sun Kirstie Allsopp told The Sun that she had spoken to Phil and that the deaths were 'tragic for the Spencer family' which is 'very loving and close'. She said that Richard and Anne, who had four children and eight grandchildren, were 'lovely people' and 'both people of Christian faith'. Kirstie added that Phil and his siblings are supporting each other through the tragedy. Phil has spoken in the past about his love of where he grew up and being the son of a farmer. He lives in Hampshire with wife Fiona and their two children and has a holiday cottage on the family farm, which his parents were in charge of before eldest David took over. A neighbour told The Sun that the fatal crash happened near a small stone bridge which locals have thought to be dangerous. Kent Police told the paper that they were called to the incident at 12.36pm on Friday to a report of a single-vehicle collision in Littlebourne. A spokeswoman said: 'Officers attended along with other emergency services and a man and woman in their 80s were taken to a local hospital where they were later pronounced deceased. 'A third person, a woman in her 60s, was in the vehicle and sustained minor injuries. 'The next of kin has been informed and a report will now be prepared for the coroner.' Also in attendance at the crash were three fire engines and a water rescue unit which took two hours to winch the car out of the river. It is not known who was driving at the time of the crash.", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Classic Queen song Fat Bottomed Girls is mysteriously dropped from the group’s new Greatest Hits collection', 'byline': 'KATIE HIND', 'time': '2023-08-19T22:01:05+0100', 'text': "It is one of Queen's best-loved songs but Fat Bottomed Girls has been mysteriously dropped from the group's new Greatest Hits collection. The 1978 track, which was written by guitarist Brian May, has been enjoyed by generations of fans as a humorous and hard-rocking tribute to a young man's appreciation of fuller-figured ladies. But 45 years later, it appears that lyrics such as 'left alone with big fat Fanny, she was such a naughty nanny, big woman, you made a bad boy out of me' and 'fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go round' have been hit by the woke cancel culture. It was such a popular hit for Queen that it appeared fourth on the band's original 1981 greatest hits album along with Bohemian Rhapsody, Don't Stop Me Now and We Will Rock You. But last week it was nowhere to be seen when Universal Records announced they would be releasing a version of the record on Yoto, the new audio platform aimed at young people. The move has left music industry insiders bemused, with bosses insisting that Fat Bottomed Girls has wrongly been singled out as it is 'merely a bit of fun'. One told The Mail on Sunday: 'It is the talk of the music industry, nobody can work out why such a good-natured, fun song can't be acceptable in today's society. 'It is woke gone mad. Why not appreciate people of all shapes and sizes like society is saying we should, rather than get rid of it. It's outrageous.' Fat Bottomed Girls has long sparked debate about the suitability of its lyrics, and the promotional material that accompanied the release. The original sleeve for the song, which was taken from Queen's album Jazz, featured a scantily clad female riding a bicycle but was altered after some stores refused to stock it. The new version was the same image with knickers drawn over the woman. May told Mojo magazine in 2008: 'I wrote it with Fred in mind, as you do, especially if you've got a great singer who likes fat bottomed girls... or boys.' The newly released Yoto greatest hits album, released in collaboration with Queen's record label Universal, is aimed at introducing the band to a younger audience.", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The Location, Location, Location star’s father Richard, known to friends and family as David, 89, and mother Anne, 82, were pulled from the vehicle but could not be saved. Phil’s co-presenter and close friend Kirstie Allsopp said yesterday it was a comfort to him that his parents were together when they died. They were on their way to a local pub for lunch on Friday when their car veered off the access road into a shallow tributary river running through their estate. Police and the fire brigade raced to the scene while an air ambulance landed on the farm at Littlebourne, near Canterbury, Kent. Richard and Anne were pulled out and taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead and she later died. A woman in her 60s was also in the car and suffered minor injuries. Phil, 53, was last night with older brother Robert and younger sisters Caryn and Helen. Kirstie said: “I’ve spoken to Phil and it’s tragic for the Spencer family, but his parents were together and that’s something that is a great source of solace to them all. “The family is very loving and close. There are four children, Phil, Robert, Caryn and Helen, and they had eight grandchildren. “This is awful for all of the family, but they were together at the end and they were lovely people. “They were on their way to the pub on a Friday afternoon in Kent, where they lived — they were in the place they loved, with the person they loved. They were both people of Christian faith. “Phil and his siblings are all consoling each other at this difficult time.” Another close pal described them as a “lovely family” who villagers were very fond of. He said: “It’s very, very sad. It’s been an absolute shock. “We’re a close-knit group around here. We all walk around the farm.” Phil, who lives in Hampshire with wife Fiona and their two children, has previously spoken fondly of being a farmer’s son, and having an idyllic childhood. He has a holiday cottage on the site, which his father ran before handing over to eldest son David. A neighbour, who has lived in a cottage next to the farm for 20 years, saw the emergency services arriving and knew it was a major incident. The woman, who asked not to be named, said the fatal accident occurred by a small stone bridge which some locals considered dangerous. She said: “There’s a stream, called the Nailbourne, which feeds into the River Stour, and there’s a very low, quite pretty little bridge that goes over it, with a lovely weeping willow. "The postman was here when it was all going on and he was saying, ‘I hope it’s not happened near the bridge — it’s dangerous that bridge’.” Another neighbour, who lives opposite the entrance, added: “I was gardening yesterday afternoon and I saw a helicopter going over. “There’s a river which runs through the farm. I was told their car ended up in it. It’s very sad.” An assistant in a local convenience store said: “It’s so sad. His parents and Phil shop here.” Kent Police said they were called at 12.36pm to a report of a single- vehicle collision at Littlebourne. A spokeswoman said: “Officers attended along with other emergency services and a man and woman in their 80s were taken to a local hospital where they were later pronounced deceased. “A third person, a woman in her 60s, was in the vehicle and sustained minor injuries. “The next of kin has been informed and a report will now be prepared for the coroner.” Three fire engines and a water rescue unit spent two hours winching the vehicle from the river. It remains unclear who was driving at the time of the accident. Retired chief superintendent Simon Ovens, former head of the Met’s traffic and transport command, said: “The main role of the police now will be to ascertain how this incident happened. “They will speak to any witnesses for an explanation of what occurred. They will also be looking if there was anything on the road at the time that might have made it happen, such as an animal or another vehicle. "Investigators will also be looking at the vehicle itself to see whether there were any mechanical defects. “Then they will be looking at the driver behind the wheel at the time to see whether the incident could have been caused by a medical \xadepisode or something like eyesight. “They will also consider whether it could have been caused by just straightforward human error.” Phil reminisced about his childhood in an interview with Great British Life. He said: “I was born there, a farmer’s son, and that’s where I spent my entire childhood and teenage years. “Dad bought the house when he got married, and they’ve never moved out. My brother runs the farm now. “Living on a farm with places to run around, have adventures and learn about nature helped us grow up with a sense of responsibility. It was a mixed farm, beef cattle, hops, watercress, potatoes, fruit and arable, which made it a lot of fun. “Mum would take us out in the holidays to help with what was being harvested. “There was always something in season so we were happy to get involved and be useful. I have lots of happy memories. “My heart was always in Kent and always will be. I feel very comfortable there.” The property expert also said his father was “dictatorial about safety” when shooting. He told Shooting Gazette: “As a young lad that side of things was drilled into me from a great height. “He was also passionate about nature and conservation.” Phil, like his father and older brother, was sent to Uppingham, the top public school in Rutland whose other', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

A boy\'s "dangerous" hound became violently out of control on Friday when officers trotted down Maroon Street, Limehouse, east London. The yapping canine, who witnesses say "went nuts", chased after one of the horses - freaking it out so badly the female constable riding it flew off the saddle. She suffered a minor injury when the horse then bolted. The owner, who is understood to be 12 years old, attempted to chase after the toothy tan Staffy mix as it attacked the police animals. Met Police officers were forced to seize the beast after it was trodden on by the horse. The disturbed horse, which sustained injuries to its leg, was recovered by officers after it made a run for it. A witness told The Sun: “Police horses usually patrol in the area, and the kids love it because they get to see them, but this dog went nuts. “The police tried to control their horses and even tried pepper spray but it ended up getting in the horse’s eyes too. “They were shouting at the family to control the dog but it ended up with the horse kicking the dog to get it to stop. “The police officer ended up falling off one of the horses too and it bolted away." The resident, who wishes to remain anonymous, said the family who own the dog is known in the area and the mutt even "lurched at a baby once". They added: "We’re all furious about it and something like this was bound to happen eventually.” A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said the dog escaped a nearby property and now remains in police kennels. They said: “At around 1650hrs on Friday, 18 August, two mounted police officers were on routine duties in Maroon Street, E14 when one of the police horses was bitten by a dog which ran out from a nearby house. “The rider of the horse, a police constable, was unseated and sustained a minor injury. She did not require hospital treatment. “The police horse sustained injuries to its leg. It bolted from the scene but was recovered by officers a short distance away with no further incident. “The dog received a minor injury as a result of being trodden on by the horse. “Both animals have been assessed by a police vet and neither was seriously hurt. The dog remains at police kennels. “An offence of ‘a dog being dangerously out of control’ has been recorded. There has been no arrest at this stage.” Tensions are already high in the area due to the deaths of two bully dogs, Marshall and Millions, who were shot dead by police.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

It comes after administrators at PwC told The Sun that several offers to rescue the chain were made on Wednesday night. At the moment, PwC is yet to confirm how many bids have been submitted to rescue Wilko. And sources said that the bids would take a while to process. They told The Sun that an announcement could come on Monday, but have since pushed back on this citing the lengthy review process. Sources at PwC have now said that while it\'s possible that an announcement could be made at the end of next week it might actually come in two weeks time. Wilko collapsed into administration last week after failing to find new backing for the business. It puts the chain\'s 400 stores at risk of closing and around 12,500 jobs on the line. But the GMB union said yesterday that there are "genuine grounds for hope" over the future of stricken retailer Wilko after expressions of interest from potential buyers during the administration process. "GMB has met with administrators and the company as part of the formal consultation process," said Andy Prendergast, GMB national secretary. "We can confirm there have been expressions of interest from organisations who are considering taking over at least some parts of the business. "These are still at an early stage, but means there are genuine grounds for hope. "Whilst this process continues staff will continue to be paid and kept on. All stores are continuing to trade, and deliveries of new stock will continue." The Sun previously reported that several potential buyers have shown an interest in Wilko\'s business, one in particular could save as many as 300 branches from closing down and would preserve the most jobs. But it is understood that early expressions of interest were mixed, and the majority of offers are for between 40 to 50 stores. Discount retailers B&M, The Range, Poundland and Home Bargains have all expressed an interest, according to sources - but they would have needed to officially throw their hats in the ring on Wednesday. The Sun understands one of the potential bidders would be keen to keep the Wilko name. But even if a buyer is found, the insolvency process means that a buyer can pick and choose the parts of a business it wants. This means that both the stores and the brand could be saved. Or it may choose to buy no stores at all and instead buy up the remaining stock or brand name only. Sources cautioned that no deal is guaranteed. Sources at both Next and Poundstretcher previously told The Sun that they had no interest in rescuing Wilko. Wilko launched a huge new sale yesterday with up to 50% off thousands of items including Christmas essentials. The Sun spoke to two sales experts to find out what items are worth picking up in the sale - and the ones to steer clear of. Fresh stock is also on the way and shops will see their aisles replenished as early as Monday. It comes as shoppers were left disappointed after spotting bare aisles in their local shop, despite the launch of the administration sale.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Football fans visiting a Greene King sports pub can bag themselves a drink on the house during this Sunday\'s games. To grab the freebie punters will need to turn up wearing either the England kit, England colours or England face paint. They\'ll then receive a free drink to enjoy during the game. The offer will be live between 11am and 2pm on Sunday, August 20. Customers can choose one free drink from a wide selection of options, including cask ales, lagers, craft beers, wines, spirits, and mixers. Punters will be able to pick from six types of cask ale including Green Kine IPA, Old Speckled Hen and Yardbird. Or if they fancy a lager, some of the chain\'s biggest bars have over 14 different types on tap including Beavertown Neck Oil, Bierra Moretti and Estrella Damm. Ciders on offer include Strongbow Dark Fruits, Thatchers Gold and Aspall. Wine drinkers are also able to choose between a glass of white, red and rose. And if you\'re after a free G&T or vodka and tonic you\'ll get a single measure and a mixer included too. Michelle West, head of sport marketing for Greene King said: "The team has performed incredibly over the course of the tournament, and we’re so excited for the final against Spain this Sunday. "This is the first time any England football team has been in a World Cup final since 1966 so we want to throw the ultimate celebration in all of our 900+ Sport pubs.

Punters can check where their nearest Greene King sports bar is by using the locator tool on the chain\'s website. The offer comes after the Lionesses roared into the final after beating hosts Australia 3-1 in Wednesday\'s semi-final thanks to goals from Ella Toone, Lauren Hemp and Alessia Russo. Tomorrow\'s final against Spain will represent the first time an England side has made a World Cup final since 1966 - and the Lionesses will be hoping it will be the first time an England side has won a World Cup trophy since then too. The final of the FIFA Women\'s World Cup 2023 will take place on Sunday August 20. The match, held at Stadium Australia in Sydney, will start at 11am UK time. The England vs Spain game will be broadcast live across the BBC, with coverage on BBC One, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport Online, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. On ITV, meanwhile, live coverage will be available on TV and online via ITVX.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Westerman, 33, ended his marriage after he was caught performing a sex act with a pal\'s wife in a dark alleyway on a boozy night After the embarrassing video, captured behind a Greggs bakery, went viral in February earlier this year, the Castleford Tigers player was kicked out by partner Lauren. But now the rugby league player has gone public with real estate agent Alison Hopkins. The loved-up homewrecker posted beaming pictures of the couple on Instagram. Mum-of-two Alison, 34, also confirmed her romance with Westerman and told the MailOnline: "Yes that\'s right but I don\'t want to say anything further thanks." Her estranged husband, Carl, 35, is understood to have been mates with the rugby player. Westerman\'s now ex-wife, Lauren, was forced to furiously defend herself and deny she was the woman in the sex act clip at the time. And, she hit back against trolls who said her 15-year-old daughter would have "seen much worse" than the X-rated clip. The distraught mum-of-three fumed: "I don’t even have words to reply to your comment apart from I’m worried at what things you watch if you think there are worse things than this for a child to see on social media of her dad." In a statement she penned: "Can I make this VERY clear that this is NOT me. "We have three children one of whom is almost 15 and she doesn\'t need to see things like this all over social media!" She previously told The Sun she had been sent the video before it was posted online. “Truth is, he only told me because it was on social media," she said. “But I\'m glad it was found because the thought of kissing him after that just makes me feel sick." The disgusted mum said: "I\'ve relived that footage over and over again. "It\'s something I\'ll never be able to get out of my mind, no matter how hard I try." But Westerman grovelled and sent text messages begging for his wife back: "Words will never ever explain how sorry I am. “I can’t explain what happened cos I physically can’t remember. “It’s disgusting and I now have to live with it forever. "Losing you and the kids is heartbreaking Lauren, you deserve so much better.” Another message read: “You always said alcohol would f*** me up." More followed, including: “I need you to know I can’t remember anything about that night. I look like a zombie.” Westerman was also forced to issue a statement after his bombshell affair was exposed. The 6ft 4ins Yorkshireman wrote an apology to family, friends, the club and to rugby league for his behaviour following a 15-hour booze fuelled bender. It read: "Firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to wholeheartedly apologise to my family and friends for my actions. "I\'d also like to apologise to the supporters, sponsors, staff, and directors of Castleford Tigers as well as my teammates. "I’d like to extend this apology to the game of rugby league, and I have realised that I need to work on my decision-making around alcohol." Westerman, who made his breakthrough in 2007 with Castleford, spent spells with Hull, Warrington, Toronto and Wakefield before returning to his first club in 2022. The 6ft 4ins Yorkshireman also has two senior international caps for England - with those coming in 2014 and 2021.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

It is lashing the Mexican state of Baja California with winds of 70 mph (119km/h). One man died there trying to cross a stream in his car. A number of houses are now submerged in the town of Santa Rosalia. Hilary is predicted to weaken as it moves north and should reach California on Sunday afternoon local time. It would be the state\'s first tropical storm in 84 years. The last time a tropical storm made landfall in southern California was in Long Beach in 1939. Experts say recent abnormal weather events that have plagued the US - and several areas across the globe - have been influenced by human-caused climate change. The storm made landfall in the northern part of Mexico\'s Baja California peninsula at 11:00 local time (18:00 GMT) on Sunday, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. It warned that Hilary could cause "life-threatening" floods in both Mexico and the US. In Mexico, 18,000 soldiers were placed on standby earlier to assist in rescue efforts. The man who died in Baja California was in a car with his wife and children, local officials said - his family survived. In Santa Rosalia, on the eastern coast of Baja California, dramatic videos have emerged showing powerful torrents of muddy water cascading down the main street. Across California, residents have been putting out sandbags, including in Long Beach and Palm Springs. Eugenie Adler, a resident of Long Beach, told Reuters: "Flooding where people lose some property is one thing, but flooding where people die is another. And I\'m afraid people might die." Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass called it "an unprecedented weather event". "But Los Angeles has deep experience responding to crises whether it be wildfire or earthquakes," she said. "The city is prepared." Nearly 26 million people in the south-western US are under flood watch. Hilary was downgraded to a Category 1 storm after weakening on Saturday, but officials kept up their warnings. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles (390 km) from its centre, according to the NHC. Nancy Ward, director of the California Governor\'s Office of Emergency Services, said Hilary could be one of the worst storms to hit the state in more than a decade. "Make no mistake," she told a press conference on Saturday. "This is a very, very dangerous and significant storm." Up to 10 in (25cm) of rain is expected in parts of Mexico, California and Nevada, according to the NHC. On Sunday, rain began to fall in southern California deserts. There is a risk of tornadoes from mid-morning through Sunday evening in parts of the Colorado River Valley, Mojave Desert and Imperial Valley. As the storm approached, Major League Baseball rescheduled three games in southern California, while SpaceX postponed the launch of a rocket from its base on the central California coast until at least Monday. The National Park Service also closed Joshua Tree National Park and Mojave National Preserve, both in California, to prevent visitors from being stranded in the event of flooding. Extreme weather has recently caused chaos across North America. In the wake of the hottest month on record, July 2023, according to Nasa, the deadliest wildfire in modern US history spread across Hawaii on 8 August, killing at least 111 people. The damage was escalated by hurricane winds passing through the area. And in Canada, hundreds of wildfires are raging in the province of British Columbia, scorching homes and forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Sara Sharif\'s body was found at her family home in Woking early on 10 August, prompting a murder inquiry. Surrey Police confirmed they wanted to speak to Sara\'s father Urfan Sharif, and his partner and brother who flew to Pakistan the day before she was found. Surrey County Council said it would "work tirelessly" to gain a "full understanding" of the situation. Council leader Tim Oliver said previously the National Child Safeguarding Panel had been notified and a multi-agency review was under way. "This Rapid Review will determine whether a Local Child Safeguarding Practice Review is to be undertaken by the Surrey Safeguarding Children Partnership," Mr Oliver said. He explained: "A Local Child Safeguarding Practice Review is a statutory process, bringing together partners including the police, health, social care and education to review practice of all agencies involved, organisational structures and learning." BBC News has been told two police teams in Jhelum, north Punjab in Pakistan, are looking for Mr Sharif. District police officer Nasir Mehmood Bajwa, in Jhelum, told the BBC that after police find Mr Sharif they are likely to take him into custody after receiving the go-ahead from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in Islamabad. Pakistan\'s foreign ministry and the FIA have not confirmed or shared any verbal or written orders on this case. Mr Sharif, his partner Beinash Batool and his brother Faisal Malik all left the UK for Pakistan on 9 August, a day before Sara\'s body was discovered. Surrey Police have said Mr Sharif, 41, made a 999 call from Pakistan shortly after landing in Islamabad with his partner, his brother and five children, aged between one and 13. The call led officers to the house in Woking where they found the body of Sara who had sustained "multiple and extensive injuries", likely to have been caused over a sustained period of time. There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Pakistan. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

Some 100,000 police and soldiers have been deployed to protect the polls. Earlier this month, a presidential candidate was assassinated. Others have said their campaigns have been marred by shootings. The snap election was called after President Guillermo Lasso - a conservative former banker - dissolved parliament to avoid impeachment. Among the eight politicians vying for the presidency, the frontrunner has been Luisa Gonzales, an ally of leftist ex-President Rafael Correa. But the assassination of candidate Fernando Villavicencio on 9 August in the capital, Quito, has made the election difficult to predict. It has also placed the focus very much on peace and security. Bulletproof vests were in evidence during the campaign and many candidates dialled down their closing events. On Saturday, gunfire erupted in a restaurant where conservative candidate Otto Sonnenholzner was having breakfast. The shooting happened in Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, which has been overrun by drug-traffickers. Mr Sonnenholzner is not believed to have been the target. But the campaign has seen a surge in gang attacks. A similar shooting occurred during a rally held by fellow candidate Daniel Noboa. And a local politician was shot dead in northern Esmeraldas province.

Article data found: {'link': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-66562938', 'title': 'Lucy Letby inquiry should be led by judge, committee chair says', 'byline': 'By James Gregory', 'time': '2023-08-20T15:40:19.000Z', 'text': 'A judge should lead the inquiry into the circumstances behind Lucy Letby\'s attacks on babies, the health select committee chairman has told the BBC. As it stands, the inquiry looking at the crimes will not have the power to compel witnesses to give evidence. Conservative MP Steve Brine said some "may not be so willing" to cooperate. Meanwhile, the prosecution\'s lead medical expert in the case has said hospital executives who failed to act should be investigated by police. Letby was found guilty of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder six others at the Countess of Chester Hospital between 2015 and 2016, following a 10-month trial. The nurse was found not guilty of two attempted murders and the jury could not reach verdicts on six others. She will be sentenced on Monday. The aim of the separate non-statutory inquiry is to ensure lessons are learned, the government has said. But concerns have been raised by some over how effective it will be in examining the case. Some have called for a statutory inquiry with legal powers to compel witnesses to give evidence. Statutory inquiries are often led by a minister-appointed judge. Non-statutory inquiries can be converted into statutory inquiries if they have been shown to cause public concern. "I think a judge-led statutory inquiry is in order here," Mr Brine told BBC Radio 4\'s Broadcasting House programme. "What I want to see... is not a process that drags on for years, an inquiry that can disappear down a rabbit hole." He added that a "proper judge-led" inquiry was the only way to ensure public confidence. Jane Tomkinson, acting chief executive officer at the Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said the trust welcomed the announcement of the independent inquiry and would be supporting the ongoing investigation by Cheshire Police. "Due to ongoing legal considerations, it would not be appropriate for the Trust to make any further comment at this time," she said. Cheshire Constabulary has been approached for comment. Mr Brine is the latest to question the powers available to the inquiry in its current form. Slater and Gordon, the law firm representing two of the families of babies attacked by Letby, said a non-statutory inquiry "is not good enough" and lessons had to be learned by the hospital, NHS and wider medical profession. Labour\'s City of Chester MP Samantha Dixon told the BBC that as it stood the inquiry would have to rely on "the goodwill of witnesses to attend". But Dr Caroline Johnson, Conservative MP and consultant paediatrician, said lessons needed to be learned quickly and the government could decide to order a statutory inquiry at a later date if extra powers were needed. Dr Bill Kirkup, who has led non-statutory reviews for other maternity units, said non-compliance had not been a problem in his experience and people were "ready and willing to cooperate". The patient safety investigator told the BBC he had identified common features between the Letby case and the reviews he had conducted - including managers accused of "protecting reputations" above listening to staff concerns. After the verdict, Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said it was "extremely sorry" the crimes happened in its hospital and it had since made "significant changes" to their services. Former chief executive of the hospital Tony Chambers and former medical director Ian Harvey, who were in charge at the time Letby was working at the hospital, have said they will co-operate fully with the inquiry. Mr Chambers has also told The Observer newspaper that he took "prompt action" including to move Letby off the neonatal unit when concerns were first escalated to him in June 2016. Dr Nigel Scawn, medical director at the Countess of Chester Hospital, said on Friday: "Since Lucy Letby worked at our hospital, we have made significant changes to our services and I want to provide reassurance to every patient that may access our services that they can have confidence in the care that they will receive." Retired consultant paediatrician Dr Dewi Evans, who gave expert evidence during the trial, said he believed the case demanded a criminal investigation into corporate manslaughter, in comments first made to the Observer. He told the BBC he intended to write to Cheshire Police to ask it to investigate bosses for not acting on the concerns of doctors. "I intend to write...[to say I] believe we need to investigate the senior executives in this hospital for what in my opinion is gross dereliction of duty and repeated failures to engage effectively with experienced senior medical professionals," he said. "The NHS is a corporate organisation with a chief executive - they have a duty of care to patients and staff. They failed patients and staff, and hospital management should be accountable to a disciplinary body in the same way doctors are."

Two huge fires in the Shuswap region merged overnight, destroying blocks of houses and other buildings. To the south, travel to the waterside city of Kelowna has been restricted, and smoke from nearby fires hangs over Lake Okanagan. Fires have charred homes in West Kelowna, a nearby city of 36,000. The travel restriction around Kelowna is designed to ensure enough accommodation for evacuees and emergency workers. It also applies to the towns of Kamloops, Oliver, Penticton and Vernon and Osoyoos. Hundreds of miles north, a huge fire continues to edge towards the city of Yellowknife. An official deadline to evacuate the city - the capital of Canada\'s Northwest Territories - lapsed on Friday. A local official said later that day that nearly all residents had left, either by car or plane. About 19,000 of the city\'s 20,000 inhabitants had evacuated. Authorities said 39 patients were moved out of a hospital to alternative facilities on Friday evening, making them the last people to be evacuated from the city. Environment and communities minister Shane Thompson said some people had chosen "to shelter in place", but urged locals to leave. In British Columbia, evacuation orders grew from covering 15,000 homes on Friday to at least 30,000 by Saturday evening. Another 36,000 homes are under evacuation alert. The province\'s emergency management minister said officials "cannot stress strongly enough how critical it is to follow evacuation orders". Bowinn Ma added: "They are a matter of life and death not only for the people in those properties, but also for the first responders who will often go back to try to implore people to leave." Premier of the province, David Eby, put the total number of people ordered to leave at 35,000, with 30,000 told to be prepared to evacuate. Canada is having its worst wildfire season on record, with at least 1,000 fires burning across the country, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC). Experts say climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires. Extreme and long-lasting heat draws more and more moisture out of the ground - which can provide fuel for fires that can spread at an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong. Although no deaths have been reported in the latest fires, at least four firefighters have lost their lives during this record-breaking season.

Kelly Choyce
Title: Senior Ambassador
Company/location: Northwest Center
About: As a graduate student from the University of Chester in Chester, England, I have previously had the opportunity to assist others with important events for their organization. During a political science conference in Scotland, I was tasked with assisting the other volunteers in setting up the registration desk for the 500 attendees. However, they did not show and I had to work with the Vice President of the event to make sure the conference ran smoothly. In order to do this, we had to effectively communicate the situation to the attendees. Duties included: setting up the registration desk at the conference venue and checking-in members for the pre-social gathering at a separate location. Back in Chattanooga, TN, I have also assisted with fundraising events by engaging with local stores and telling them about how they can get involved with the fundraiser. Currently, I am a Senior Ambassador who supports Amazon's Corporate events. I have found my forte in assisting others in making their events successful.

Carmona's father is understood to have died on Friday but news was kept from the 23-year-old so as not to affect her frame of mind going into the game against England. The Spanish football federation tweeted after the game: 'We deeply regret to announce the death of Olga Carmona's father. The footballer learnt the sad news after the World Cup final. We love you, Olga, you are part of Spanish football history.' Carmona had celebrated her first half goal with a message on her shirt for a friend whose mother had just died. It was reminiscent of men's player Andres Iniesta's gesture to his late friend Dani Jarque when he got Spain's winning goal in the men's World Cup final in 2010. Carmona, a left back, was named player of the match and also scored a late winner in Spain's semi-final win over Sweden. She celebrated her team's success on the pitch with her team-mates, dancing around the Sydney Stadium. In an interview, she said: 'We felt this team had something special'. Spain celebrated their win in style out on the pitch with Queen Letizia even making her way to the centre of the team photograph and lifting the trophy. She was then presented with a Spain shirt with a number 12 on the back and had to politely decline as the entire squad chanted for her to put it on. Protocol was forgotten as Spain became only the second nation, after Germany, to have won both men's and women's World Cups. 'We dedicate it to all our families and to the people back in Spain,' said Jennifer Hermoso who missed a penalty, 'we have played football the way we wanted to and we have won a world championship.' Back in Spain they had been queuing two hours before kick-off outside of the 6,000 capacity WiZink Center in Madrid, one of around 30 fan sites set up around the country to show the final. On 90 minutes there was a communal gulp as the fourth official showed that 13 minutes were to be added on, but once the final whistle had been blown the euphoria was released. 'We got revenge in the most important of games,' said Diario AS remembering how England had knocked Spain out of the Euros in the quarter-finals a year ago. 'It's nice that we are breaking down barriers and that we are being talked about,' said midfielder Teresa Abelleira. The attention is unlikely to diminish any time soon. Spain are due to arrive back home to Madrid on Monday night where they will go straight into a trophy parade in the Spanish capital. However, their victory and subsequent celebrations have attracted controversy after the president of the Spanish FA Luis Rubiales kissed forward Jenni Hermoso on the podium as the players collected their medals. Rubiales threw his arms around Hermoso and gave her a strong hug while whispering in her ear. He then put both his hands on the back of her head and kissed her on the lips. Hermoso was asked about the embrace after the match by Spanish TV station La 1 and, appearing somewhat uncomfortable, told them: 'Eh... yeah, I did not enjoy that.' She said the same thing when asked on a livestream on her Instagram from Spain's dressing rooms. Footage of the kiss has gone viral online since it was seen on air, with some supporters hugely critical of Rubiales' behaviour. One infuriated fan said: 'The behaviour of Rubiales on that podium was absolutely grim. Highly highly inappropriate!' Another added: 'This is just awful, there’s absolutely nothing justifying Rubiales behaviour.' A further angry individual highlighted their disdain at the attitude of a senior figure in Spanish football. They said: 'The concerning fact here is the nonchalant manner Rubiales behaves towards Hermoso. The FA president does this on the biggest stage of the sport with royalty and officials near him, surrounded by cameras. Very disturbing, and frankly, concerning.' One individual even insisted it was a worrying sign for the future of the sport as they added: 'It’s sad to think that women’s football is not going to progress very far if men like Rubiales, Vilda, and Infantino remain in powerful positions.'", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The killer nurse, 33, is expected to refuse to appear in the dock when the judge imposes her punishment tomorrow. It means Letby will also avoid listening to victim impact statements, prepared by the families of those she murdered and harmed, explaining how she devastated their lives. MPs and parents of the infants tonight demanded new legislation be fast-tracked to force serious offenders to 'face the music'. One father, whose twin boys Letby tried to murder, told the Mail her refusal to appear at Manchester Crown Court was a 'slap in the face' for her victims. 'I'm so angry that Letby is refusing to come to court to hear her sentence,' he said. 'She is a coward and we feel cheated that she will not be present to hear exactly how her terrible actions have affected our boys and our lives. 'What gives her the right to refuse to come up from the cells or to tell the judge that she doesn't intend to listen to his sentence? The law must change. The judge should be given the power to summon her into the dock to face myself, my wife and all the other victims who desperately want her to hear our victim impact statements. 'It is a total injustice and slap in the face for us all. The British justice system needs to change, to ensure that, in the future, all victims' voices are heard by those that perpetrate such horrendous crimes.' On Friday, Letby was convicted of the murder of seven babies and the attempted murder of six more at the Countess of Chester Hospital, in Cheshire. By then, she was already refusing to enter the dock and her barrister, Ben Myers KC, indicated to the judge, Mr Justice Goss, that his client would not be appearing before him for sentencing. The judge is likely to impose a whole life tariff, meaning Letby will never be freed. She is likely to become only the fourth woman in British legal history to be given such a punishment. The Government is expected to include changes to legislation requiring offenders to be present in court for sentencing in the King's Speech in November. The proposals will compel offenders to attend or impose an increased jail sentence if they refuse by making 'no shows' a contempt of court. But this extra punishment would have little effect on the most serious criminals, such as Letby, who have no prospect of ever being freed. Tory former justice secretary Robert Buckland said there should be 'nowhere to hide' for offenders such as Letby and suggested the sentencing be played into her cell, regardless of her wishes. He said changes could be made to the Victims Bill, which is going through Parliament, or emergency legislation drafted to get the changes into law quicker. Sir Robert told GB News: 'Sadly, the court's hands are tied at the moment. My suggestion would be to make sure there was a live link beamed into the cell of the sound and/or send pictures to ensure that Letby has nowhere to hide and has to listen to what the judge is saying about the case.' The twins' father said: 'I agree with the suggestion of having cameras in cells so video can be beamed in – Letby should have nowhere to hide.' Letby's refusal to appear comes after a series of high-profile cases where criminals have avoided coming to court to hear their fate, denying victims the satisfaction of seeing them sent down. They include Thomas Cashman, 34, who shot and killed nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel. His absence from court in April was described by Olivia's mother, Cheryl, 46, as a 'kick in the teeth'. By refusing to admit to her abhorrent crimes, Letby has already compounded the misery of her victims' families by dragging them through a harrowing trial. Her refusla to attend tomorrow's sentencing now denies them some much-needed emotional succour. For justice to be seen to be done, those families need to be able to look this contemptible woman in the eye as punishment is handed down. Tamlin Bolton, of Switalskis Solicitors, who represents parents of several of Letby's victims, said: 'It really is the final insult. For Letby to refuse to face these parents speaks of cowardice and shows a complete disregard for the damage she has caused.' Steve Brine, the Conservative chairman of the health select committee, added: 'Lucy Letby 100 per cent should be present to face the music and Parliament should legislate to make sure that defendants do so.' Tory former Cabinet minister David Jones told the Mail: 'It will be devastating to the families of the murdered babies if Letby is not in the dock when sentence is passed. Nothing can ever heal their pain, but it will not be true justice if she is not made to face the consequences of her actions in public. It must never happen again in this country, either. The law can't be changed quickly enough.' Whole-life sentences are reserved for multiple killings, cases involving terrorism, abduction, sexual abuse, pre-planning, the murder of an on-duty police or prison officer, or if the defendant has already been convicted of a murder. The only other women to receive the sentence are Moors murderer Myra Hindley – who died in 2002 – serial killer Rose West and Joanna Dennehy, who stabbed three men to death. Lord Falconer, former Lord Chancellor, said: 'Refusing to attend the sentencing should be an aggravating factor judges can take into account in increasing the sentence. In this case, the appropriate sentence is likely to be so heavy that such a power will make little or no difference. 'All the judge can do is acknowledge and condemn this final cruelty by Letby. For the families of her victims, there is no escape, no ability to avoid the worst by being absent from the difficult times.", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Emergency services rushed to the scene on Velour Close at around 2.30pm on Friday after residents heard a woman 'screaming for help'. A woman and two men were - who are mother, father, and son - were found to have sustained stab wounds. Moments before, witnesses reported hearing a 'commotion' in a nearby apartment before seeing 'three men in balaclavas' fleeing the scene in a car. The victims were taken to hospital as a cordon was put in place at the scene and a forensics team arrived. The mother and son have been discharged however the father has undergone surgery for a life-changing injury. A witness described that as many as six ambulances and 10 police vans and cars attended the scene. A resident on the street said they heard a woman 'screaming for help' before they immediately called the police, adding they knew 'something was seriously wrong'. 'I heard the screams coming from the flat,' they said. 'I thought it was a domestic but then things got more heated, there was a commotion and all of a sudden things were being thrown around and I knew something was seriously wrong.' 'It was so loud I thought it was outside. They were screaming and shouting and a woman was screaming for help from the window.' The resident added: 'There was a car outside that I didn't realise had anything to do with it. Then, about four to five minutes later, three individuals came running out completely covered up, jumped in the car and sped off. 'Other neighbours ran in to make sure everything was okay. It's very unusual to have anything happening around here, it's very jarring and concerning.' An air ambulance reportedly landed nearby following the incident, with police taping off the area - including a large car park for flats and houses on the estate. Forensic teams remained at the scene for two days until Sunday afternoon, by which the remains of police tape were left and blood was still seen on the carpet at the entrance to the apartment block. Greater Manchester Police, who were initially called to reports of a man and woman 'shouting for help', launched an investigation into what they called an 'isolated and targeted' attack. They are appealing for witnesses or anybody with information to come forward and are still hunting the three suspects. Detective Chief Inspector Yanica Weir said: 'This appears to be an isolated, targeted and unprovoked attack, in which three men in masks and balaclavas were seen leaving the address on Velour Close following the attack. 'We are carrying out house-to-house enquiries and doing a CCTV trawl from the area, and we are now looking for anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident, to come forward. 'If anyone has any CCTV, mobile or dashcam footage in or around Velour Close on Friday 18 August, to please let us know.'", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Gallup's latest worker poll found nearly six in 10 adults in America are quiet quitting after the pandemic caused people to prioritize their 'me time'. But a new trend that piggybacks on this premise has emerged - the 'lazy girl' job. The term went viral thanks to a TikTok video with millions of views. The premise of a lazy girl job is simple: Low stress, low effort, with lots of flexibility and freedom. These jobs are remote, require no overtime, are physically safe, and there's minimum to no supervision. TikTokker @gabrielle_judge defined them as jobs with laid-back bosses and comfortable salaries that pay the bills but don't require a chaotic work schedule. It's the antithesis of the 'girl boss' movement or 'leaning in' — constant hustling and long hours to climb to the top. What kind of jobs are we talking about, exactly?

Gen Zers, especially, are interested. It's even popular enough that it's got a Wikipedia page. Workamajig crunched the numbers (TikTok search volume) to find the 25 most popular lazy girl roles. Together, #lazygirljob and #lazygirljobs have a combined 25 million-plus views. Using KeywordTool, we analyzed various roles aligned with the 'lazy girl jobs' trend, according to TikTok and Reddit users, to find the most searched on TikTok. Data was pulled by searching different jobs—like 'Community Moderator job' —and ranked based on the number of TikTok searches they've had on the app in the U.S. as of August 10 to determine TikTok's most popular 'lazy girl jobs.' Search data is correct as of August 10, 2023, and analyzed over the preceding year. Maybe it's the branding Many complaints about the term come from those who say it paints a bad picture. Social media strategist Michael Durwin told the Wall Street Journal the movement makes sense, but the name is all wrong. 'I think younger women are using it almost in a way that they don't understand the damage it can do,' he says. But would the term have gone so viral with a more acceptable term like 'work-life balance?' Probably not. How can you get a lazy girl job? It's time to start applying, but you need the right resume. The algorithms that scan resumes are picky — but social to the rescue once again. Here's a viral hack jobseekers say really works. It's called 'white fonting.' Copy the relevant keywords from a job you're applying to, paste them into your resume, and then change the font color to white. The color change makes the keywords invisible to a real person reading, but AI bots will pick them up and potentially bump you to the top of the list. It's not always a guaranteed win, so be mindful of the process where you're applying. Some programs and job sites automatically scan your resume and input sections into an application. If that's the case, your white font may also slip through to human eyes.", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The truth was quite different — he had motor neurone disease and was becoming increasingly disabled. The truth only became apparent when he died earlier this month and it shows that far from being on the rocks, their relationship was devoted and loving. It made me think how little we really know about what goes on in people’s lives and how ready we are to jump to conclusions. I’ve seen this many times with patients, whose friends and families have assumed one thing, only for something quite different to be the reality. It can be very hurtful. Sandra’s devotion is a timely reminder not to jump to nasty conclusions — you never really know what people are coping with behind closed doors. August is supposed to be a time of relaxation and fun. It’s about sitting on the beach licking a 99, reading a trashy novel, catching up with friends. But it’s also always been a time of anxiety for some youngsters and their families waiting for their exam results and then dealing with the fall out when they arrive. It was A-levels last week and GCSE results are out on Thursday. Some will, of course, have cause to celebrate, but for those who don’t get the results they were hoping for, it can be a fraught and upsetting time. This year, thanks to Covid, there will be more teenagers than usual nursing bruised egos and shattered dreams. I’m furious at the way youngsters were let down by our response to Covid. Many of us felt lockdowns were the wrong decision, but we were ignored at the time. Teaching unions were shameless in their insistance that schools remain closed despite it becoming clear that the risks were tiny. We panicked and sacrificed an entire generation. But we are where we are and while it’s right to be angry at the way youngsters were let down, there’s also an important lesson to be learned here — that we are also letting down the younger generation by failing to encourage them to develop resilience. It’s this that will prepare them for the inevitable disappointments in life. Developing resilience is far better than covering someone in bubble wrap, because it is about building an inner strength and confidence on which they can rely, rather than counting on an external shield to protect them. Yet it seems younger people today rely more on being protected from life’s ups and downs, and seem to lack grit and fortitude. But indulging this in the long term does them no favours, because people can’t be protected entirely from life. We have to learn how to deal with difficulties. You can’t protect someone from everything life might throw at them — Covid lockdowns being a perfect example — but you can give them the skills they need to cope with it. It’s like giving someone a kit-bag of tools to deal with life’s vicissitudes. Resilience isn’t just about coping with adversity. The same characteristics that help with resilience also let people get the most out of their life — it gives them a confidence and assuredness to push themselves. I’d encourage everyone to go on a resilience-building course. There are also some great books on the topic too, such as Option B by Sheryl Sandberg and Developing Resilience by Michael Neenan. But there are also some simple things we can all do to help children and teenagers build resilience. Encourage them to throw themselves in to it. It may take a few attempts and there will be setbacks but, when they achieve this, it will act as a blueprint for future goals as they have shown themselves that they can do something when they put their mind to it. Allow them to use at least some of their earnings to reward themselves. From the youngsters I’ve seen in clinics, you can almost always tell the ones who have had some type of part-time work, as they have a maturity that sets them apart. Help them to identify and name their emotions and validate these feelings. Emphasise that they are in control of how they feel and help them find strategies for managing their feelings. If you don’t have the answer, reassure them you’ll find the answer together. Recall when they had difficulties in the past and how they coped, and remind them things did get better again. Calls to stop sugary cereals and yoghurts having cartoon characters on their packets have been rejected by ministers. Good for them. We do have a problem with obesity in children, but it’s not the responsibility of the state to make these things less appealing — it’s the responsibility of parents to say no. What’s the point of making nitrous oxide a Class C drug? Ministers are proposing to recategorise the gas — also known as laughing gas — under new legislation. It would make it illegal to possess, supply, import, export or produce it for anything other than a legitimate purpose. Anyone caught in possession would face up to two years in jail or an unlimited fine. There’s no doubt that it’s a problem — it was the third most commonly used drug last year. It’s been linked to medical problems as well as antisocial behaviour. But why ban it when we have given up enforcing the law around cannabis? It makes no sense. We know that cannabis can have a devastating impact on mental health. The ban on nitrous oxide feels more like politicians wanting to be seen to ‘do something’ rather than engage in the debate around drugs and society that we urgently need to have.

Women tend to be quoted more on topics such as lifestyle, entertainment, and healthcare, while men tend to feature more in articles about sports, politics, and business.

The female sources quoted in this text may play a personal or highly specific role in the story and therefore be hard to replace with other sources. Nonetheless, you might want to consider including more male perspectives.

Results statement and text:  We were not able to confidently determine the gender of any of the additional sources quoted.
Gender is complex and not limited to "male" or "female". Furthermore, naming conventions vary by culture and individual preference, so it is not always possible to accurately determine the gender of a person by their name alone.
Nonetheless, it is always good to try to get diverse perspectives in your story.

Olga Carmona scored the only goal of the women\'s final against England and was later pictured joyfully kissing the trophy. But hours afterwards the left-back was told of the family tragedy. There was extra poignancy as she had celebrated scoring by raising her jersey to reveal a tribute to a friend\'s mother, who had died. Carmona explained the meaning of the “Merchi” message after the game. The Spanish FA issued a statement to share their sadness at the death of their goal hero\'s dad. It read: "The @RFEF deeply regrets to report the death of Olga Carmona\'s father. The soccer player learned the sad news after the World Cup final. "We send our most sincere hugs to Olga and her family in a moment of deep pain. "We love you, Olga, you are the history of Spanish football." Real Madrid star Carmona, 23, has a 24-year-old brother, Fran, who plays as a centre-back for Sevilla C. Fans on social media sent their sympathy. One posted: "This is such a heartbreaking news. This was supposed to be the best day of her life. She made her father proud." Another wrote: "Can\'t imagine how those feelings mix, awful to hear. RIP." A third said of her father: "At least he saw his daughter reach the World Cup final and score in the semis." Carmona gave Spain their first ever Women\'s World Cup crown by slotting home on 29 minutes. Lionesses\' keeper Mary Earps saved a penalty from Jenni Hermoso as Jorge Vilda\'s Spaniards deservedly triumphed.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The serial killer was found guilty on Friday of murdering seven babies - making her Britain\'s most prolific child killer. But Lucy\'s heinous crimes were unmasked during a nearly 10-month trial where it was revealed she also attempted to kill six other newborns. Now, Detective Superintendent Paul Hughes - a leading detective in the case - said he believes the sick nurse had actually anticipated her arrest. Mr Hughes said Letby’s unusual but “controlled” manner during police interviews raised suspicions that she had been expecting a visit from cops. The Cheshire Constabulary officer, who led the investigation, said Letby appeared remarkably calm for someone arrested for the first time. “She was emotionless, she cooperated, she answered the questions,” he said in an interview with The Mail on Sunday. Mr Hughes added: “It was surprising – this was someone who had never been involved with police before in her life. “She’s arrested for eight murders and six attempted murders and brought into custody. At no point did she appear to be struggling with anything. She was quiet, she wasn’t obstructive, she dealt with everything, she was controlled." And he claimed that there seemed to be an "acceptance" on Lucy\'s behalf that cops would be arriving at her door one day. The Detective Superintendent continued: “There was no banging on the table, at no point did she say: ‘You’re saying these babies have been killed. I cared for these babies, go and find the killer, it’s not me’. "There was very much an acceptance that we were going to come and knock on her door at some point.” His colleague Detective Sergeant Danielle Stonier echoed these observations and claimed the twisted health worker was unusually calm and "devoid of emotion" when being quizzed. She told MailOnline: "The Lucy Letby you saw in court was the Lucy Letby I interviewed. "Her tone, her approach to answering questions, even the pauses, were very much the same. "Lucy Letby was calm, she was quite cool, she answered the questions, she was confident with the answers. She talked but there was no emotion." Letby, 33, was questioned three times between July 2018 and November 2020, when she was finally charged. She was interviewed for more than 20 hours. DS Stonier said the "big moment" came when officers revealed the results of blood tests to Letby, which proved two of the babies had been deliberately poisoned – eight months apart - with insulin. "She had little to no understanding of that," Mrs Stonier added. "I remember reading out those results and I don\'t think she knew what it meant." Mrs Stonier added that Letby did not wail or cry while being charged. The Detective Sergeant said that she "appeared composed", adding that she "had an ability to mentally switch off, to disengage just to get through it." Described as “beige” by cops, there was nothing spectacular about the nurse that suggested at first she could be behind the killings. But post-January 2015, the number of baby deaths and catastrophic collapses at the hospital significantly rose and links started to become clear. Consultants grew concerned when they realised the children who died had “deteriorated unexpectedly”. The babies who collapsed also did not respond to appropriate and timely resuscitation. Footage was earlier released of Letby\'s police interview after she was first arrested in July 2018. In some cases, Letby allegedly took up to three attempts before she managed to kill some of her victims. Police searched her three-bedroom home in Chester on July 3, 2018, after she was arrested and discovered a chilling cache of evidence. The nurse had scribbled haunting notes in diaries and on Post-It notes, including one that read: “I am evil I did this”.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The nurse, who murdered seven newborns, is refusing to attend court for sentencing today. But former Justice Secretary Sir Robert Buckland insisted the proceedings should be played in her cell regardless of her wishes. He said yesterday: “Sadly, the court’s hands are tied. My suggestion would be to make sure there was a live link beamed into the cell of the sound and/or send pictures to ensure that Letby has nowhere to hide and in fact has to listen to what the judge is saying about the case. “Most importantly, she needs to hear the victims’ personal statements as that will bring home the appalling and devastating impact of the loss of these innocent babies.” Letby, 33, is expected to become only the third woman alive to be handed a whole life term, meaning she will never be released from prison. Under laws set to be proposed in the King’s Speech later this year, offenders will be required to attend court to hear their punishment. Sir Robert, who served as Justice Secretary from 2019 to 2021, said: “I’m glad the Government is taking necessary action.” Letby targeted newborns at the Countess of Chester Hospital during a year-long murder spree. Senior NHS managers missed multiple opportunities to stop her, tried to silence suspicious doctors and delayed calling cops. Meanwhile, calls for a judicial inquiry are growing. At present, the probe into Letby will not have the power to force witnesses to give evidence. A SENIOR detective investigating Lucy Letby was “surprised” by how controlled she was when presented with horrific evidence. Det Supt Paul Hughes said the nurse was emotionless, adding: “It was surprising. This was someone who had never been involved with police before. She was quiet and she was controlled. His colleague, Det Sgt Danielle Stonier who also quizzed Letby, recalled: “Some of the evidence we were putting to her was really graphic. But she was calm, cool and confident.”', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Assessors are also told that a lie by a claimant should not mean their application is booted out. Some Tory MPs rounded on the Government over guidance stating migrants are not obliged to answer questions they find “upsetting”. There is also concern over the use of video call interviews rather than face-to-face grillings by assessors. Ex-Cabinet Minister David Davis said: “The case workers should be deeply sceptical and be on the look-out for fraud and abuse.” An extra 700 case workers are being recruited — bringing the total to 2,500 — in a bid to clear the backlog of 170,000 claims. Guidance tells the officials to use non-threatening body language — such as keeping arms uncrossed and smiling when deemed appropriate. They are also told asylum seekers do not have to prove their sexual orientation if they claim to be fleeing persecution on the grounds of being bisexual, gay or lesbian. By law, claimants cannot be probed about their sexual preferences or activity. Tory MP Marco Longhi, who sits on the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: “This guidance shows how utterly broken our system is.” The Home Office said its processes ensure “claims are properly considered”.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The lead guitarist and singer said he was inspired by a terrifying experience which saw him almost lose his voice forever. He suffered a haemorrhaged growth on his vocal cords and had to have surgery earlier this year, prompting him to write Dancing On The Head Of A Needle, which came out on Friday. The former I’m A Celeb campmate said: “Around the time that I wrote this song, people who were really close to me were going through things of their own, and because I was so far down this dark road after losing my voice, I was unable to acknowledge that I needed to be there for them. “It’s a bit like my apology to the people I let down, but also to myself, for not being able to see the warning signs. I was deteriorating into a place that was almost too far down to reach.” In February he was ordered to stay silent for three weeks after finding the lesion on his vocal cords but his health issues persisted and it eventually had to be treated. With The Vamps he has released four albums, played arena tours and had hit singles including Wild Heart, Last Night and Can We Dance. However, they have insisted they haven’t split up and are just pursuing their own projects before working on their next album, having only recently completed a tour. Speaking to The Sun last year, James said: "It\'s really important that for us, there\'s no personal issues or animosity with anything anyone is doing. "It\'s not like a power struggle for musical satisfaction, kudos or credibility. "There\'s a strong Vamps strategy and alongside that there will be other things. The last thing we want fans to think is that we are divided and hate each other. It\'s not like that. "Things will come from probably all of us I imagine at some point, in various ways." His bandmate Brad Simpson added: "We are all working on separate things. "We\'re all into different types of music so it\'s nice to explore those different avenues and I actually think that\'s going to be really interesting when we come back to writing."', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The 33-year-old was convicted on Friday of murdering seven babies and attempting to kill six other infants at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Letby deliberately injected babies with air, force fed others milk and poisoned two of the infants with insulin. She refused to appear in the dock for her sentencing hearing. The judge proceeded without her and said he was addressing her as if she were in the dock. Letby was given multiple whole-life terms - one for each offence - becoming only the fourth woman in UK history to receive such a sentence. Whole-life orders are the most severe punishment available and are reserved for those who commit the most heinous crimes. Mr Justice Goss said the "cruelty and calculation" of Letby\'s actions between June 2015 and June 2016 were "truly horrific". "You acted in a way that was completely contrary to the normal human instincts of nurturing and caring for babies and in gross breach of the trust that all citizens place in those who work in the medical and caring professions," he said. He added handover sheets relating to all but the first four babies were found when police searched Letby\'s home, which he was satisfied she kept as "morbid records". Passing sentence, he said: "There was a malevolence bordering on sadism in your actions. "During the course of this trial you have coldly denied any responsibility for your wrongdoing. "You have no remorse. There are no mitigating factors." He said Letby, originally from Hereford, would be provided with copies of his remarks and the personal statements of the parents. Ben Myers KC, defending Letby, said the neonatal nurse had "maintained her innocence throughout these proceedings" so there was nothing he was "able to add in mitigation that was capable of reducing the sentence". As the hearing began, there was silence, which hung heavy, as those in courtroom seven at Manchester Crown Court waited for the judge to enter the room. Eight of the jurors who tried Letby over 10 months were in attendance. Some were visibly upset as they heard about the grief, loss and distress suffered by each family. Parents cried quietly in the public gallery as victim impact statements were heard. Their words made it clear the effect on their lives would be never-ending. Letby\'s parents, who had been present throughout her trial, did not attend her sentence hearing. The mother of a baby boy killed by Letby said she was "horrified that someone so evil exists". Addressing an empty dock, the mother of Baby C, who became emotional, told the court that knowing now that her son\'s murderer had been watching over them throughout those traumatic hours was like "something out of a horror story". The mother of Baby D, who was holding a toy rabbit as she read her statement, said Letby\'s "wicked sense of entitlement and abuse of her role as a trusted nurse" was a "scandal". Baby E and F\'s mother described Letby as a "coward" for failing to attend the sentencing hearing, adding: "Our world was shattered when we encountered evil disguised as a caring nurse." "We have attended court day in and day out, yet she decides she has had enough, and stays in her cell - just one final act of wickedness from a coward," she said. The parents of Baby G, who was the most premature of all the babies, weighing just 535g (1lb 3oz), and who now requires constant care, told the court: "God saved her" but then "the devil found her". The parents of Baby N, who Letby attempted to murder in June 2016, said the family still had a camera in their now seven-year-old\'s bedroom so they can check on him while he sleeps. "We are extremely protective," they said. This is a distressing case so if you, or someone you know, need help after reading about it, the details of organisations offering assistance can be found on the BBC Action Line website. A total of 70 criminals are serving a whole-life order, four of whom are being held in secure hospitals. They will never be considered for release, unless there are exceptional compassionate grounds to warrant it. The other women to have been given a whole-life sentence are serial killers Rose West and Joanna Dennehy, as well as Moors murderer Myra Hindley, who died in 2002. Sir Keir Starmer has urged the government to "get on" and bring forward proposals to force offenders to face their victims after Letby refused to appear in the dock. "I want to see action as quickly as possible in this case, because victims\' families have been through the most awful ordeal," he said. "I hope the government will do it because I think it can be done very quickly." Writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said Letby was "not just a murderer but a coward, whose failure to face her victims\' families, refusing to hear their impact statements and society\'s condemnation, is the final insult". "We are looking to change the law so offenders can be compelled to attend sentencing hearings," he said. Earlier Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also said it was "cowardly" for convicted criminals not to face victims or their families in court. The government has ordered an independent inquiry into the circumstances behind Letby\'s killing spree but, as it stands, the inquiry will not have the power to compel witnesses to give evidence. As a result of this, concerns have been raised by some about how effective the inquiry will be in examining the case. Among them is Labour\'s City of Chester MP Samantha Dixon who told the BBC the inquiry would have to rely on "the goodwill of witnesses to attend". The lead consultant at the neonatal unit where Letby worked previously said hospital bosses failed to investigate allegations and', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The former nurse will spend the rest of her life in prison, with no chance of parole, for murdering seven babies and trying to kill six others. Their parents gave victim impact statements before she was sentenced. Some of the surviving babies have been left with disabilities, they said. In court, families of the babies sat in the public gallery, some crying quietly. Members of the jury were also visibly upset as they listened to the statements. Letby refused to attend court to hear the suffering she had caused. Reporting restrictions protect the identities of the babies and their families, so they are referred to as babies A to P. Warning: This article contains details some readers may find upsetting "You thought it was your right to play God with our children\'s lives." The twins were attacked in June 2015 - Baby A was murdered on 8 June and Letby attempted to kill his sister 28 hours later. "Our minds are so traumatised it won\'t let us remember the night you killed our child," their mother said in a statement. "After losing (Baby A) we were riddled with fear for his sister (Baby B). We are so thankful that we had that fear for her, as it saved her life... there was always a member of our family at her side watching." "Little did we know you were waiting for us to leave so you could attack," she added. "You thought you could enter our lives and turn it upside down but you will never win. We hope you live a very long life and spend every day suffering for what you\'ve done." "Knowing his murderer was watching us was like something out of a horror story." The mother of Baby C remembered the "overwhelming wave of emotion" she felt when she first held Baby C, whom she called "my tiny feisty boy". He was murdered on 14 June, 2015. She wore her first-born\'s hand and footprints around her neck after his death. But when Letby was arrested she felt "so conflicted" - the nurse had been the one to take those prints. She cried as she spoke of the impact Letby has had on her family: "There is no sentence that will ever compare to the excruciating agony that we have suffered as a consequence of your actions." "I was desperate to feel her, smell her, cuddle her." The mother of Baby D held a toy rabbit as she spoke from the witness box. After her daughter was murdered on 22 June 2015, she pushed for answers, but she was initially told it was not a police matter. "I missed (Baby D) so much. I was desperate to feel her, smell her, cuddle her. I was desperate to keep her safe." She said she lost confidence "as a woman, as a friend, as a wife", and said her marriage suffered. "It has been hard to keep strong together at times." "Since (Baby D) passed away I live behind my own shadow." "Our worlds were shattered when we encountered evil disguised as a caring nurse." Letby murdered Baby E on 4 August 2015. She attempted to murder his brother 24 hours later. The mother of the twin boys said the family had been "living with a life sentence because of Letby\'s crimes". She said her surviving son had been left with complex needs after the attack. She is still frightened to leave him alone. When Letby was first identified as a murder suspect, she and her husband felt "cheated, deceived and utterly heartbroken". She described Letby\'s absence from court as "just one final act of wickedness from a coward". "Her condition affects every aspect of our lives." Baby G was left severely disabled by Letby. The nurse was found guilty of attempting to murder her twice, in September 2015. "Every day I would sit there and pray. I would pray for God to save her. He did. He saved her, but the devil found her," her father said of their time in hospital. The court heard Baby G is now registered blind, has cerebral palsy and progressive scoliosis. Her father said she needs substantial care and that her mother only gets about two hours of sleep a night. "We see other families and their children fishing, playing football, other things we can\'t do. She will never have a sleepover, go to high school, have a boyfriend, get married." "A part of us died with her." Baby I was alert, content and feeding well before she died, her mother said. The family was planning to bring their daughter home when they were told she\'d had another collapse, on 23 October 2015. Letby was found guilty of murdering her. "She was our gorgeous little princess and I can\'t even begin to explain the pain when we lost her." The mother said her whole body was shaking when she was told someone had been arrested for murder. "We were both absolutely broken that someone could do something so evil to our precious little girl." She has had therapy and taken medication over the past six years to cope with her daughter\'s death. "We have been in some very dark places mentally." After the death of Baby I, they had another daughter who was born prematurely and with sepsis, but she said she found it incredibly hard to be back on a neonatal unit. She refused to leave her daughter\'s side until she came home. "We struggle with trust. I won\'t leave my kids in a hospital. We will never give anyone that type of trust with our kids again. I don\'t think we will ever get over the fact that our daughter was tortured until she had no fight left in her." "Letby kept looking over at me."

Sara Sharif\'s body was found at her family home in Woking, Surrey, early on 10 August, prompting a murder inquiry. Jacquie Chambers, head of St Mary\'s C of E primary school in Byfleet, said Sara would be "dearly missed". Three people who travelled to Pakistan before her body was found are believed to have gone to Islamabad and are wanted for questioning. Ms Chambers said: "She was a bubbly, confident little girl who had the most beautiful smile. She was full of ideas and was very passionate about the things she believed in." The head teacher said the pupil had been in Year 5 at the school, adding: "Sara will be dearly missed and, as a school community, we are all deeply affected by this tragedy. "Our thoughts, prayers and sympathy are with those affected by this heart-breaking news." Ms Chambers said she could not make further comment due to the police inquiry, but said the school was "fully supporting partner agencies with their investigations". She added: "Our priority now is to support our school community as they grieve and recover." The three people who are wanted by the police are Sara\'s father, Urfan Sharif, 41, his partner, Beinash Batool, 29, and his brother, Faisal Malik, 28. BBC News has been told two police teams in Jhelum, north Punjab in Pakistan, are looking for Mr Sharif. Surrey Police have said Mr Sharif, 41, made a 999 call from Pakistan shortly after landing in Islamabad with his partner, his brother and five children, aged between one and 13. The call led officers to the house in Woking where they found the body of Sara who had sustained "multiple and extensive injuries", likely to have been caused over a sustained period of time. There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Pakistan. Surrey County Council have confirmed that Sara was known to the authorities and a multi-agency review is under way. Police have also been searching the family\'s previous address in West Byfleet in Surrey. Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on Twitter, and on Instagram.

Article data found: {'link': 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-66573842', 'title': 'Ukrainian drone destroys Russian supersonic bomber', 'byline': 'By Graeme Baker', 'time': '2023-08-21T16:44:46.000Z', 'text': 'A flagship Russian long-range bomber has been destroyed in a Ukrainian drone strike, according to reports. Images posted on social media and analysed by BBC Verify show a Tupolev Tu-22 on fire at Soltsy-2 airbase, south of St Petersburg. Moscow said that a drone was hit by small-arms fire but managed to "damage" a plane. Ukraine has not commented. The Tu-22 can travel at twice the speed of sound and has been used extensively by Russia to attack cities in Ukraine. The Russian Ministry of Defence said in a statement that an attack by a "copter-type UAV" took place at around 10:00 Moscow time (08:00 BST) on Saturday. It stated the location as "a military airfield in the Novgorod region", where Soltsy-2 is situated. "The UAV was detected by the airfield\'s observation outpost and was hit with small-arms fire," the ministry said. "One airplane was damaged; there were no casualties as a result of the terrorist act." The statement also said a fire which broke out in the airfield parking lot was quickly extinguished. However, images posted on the social media platform Telegram showed a large fire engulfing a jet with the distinctive nose cone of the Tu-22. BBC Verify analysed the images and believes them to be credible. While the destruction of a single aircraft will have little effect on the potency of Moscow\'s current 60-strong fleet, the operation highlights Kyiv\'s growing ability to strike targets deep inside Russian territory. Kyiv has over recent months launched dozens of fixed-wing unmanned aircraft to attack Moscow, a journey of several hundred miles. Soltsy-2 is around 400 miles (650km) from the Ukraine border. However, the Russian MoD\'s description of the drone as a "copter-type UAV" suggests a cheap, commercially available device launched at short range. The Tu-22 is a Cold War-era, swing-wing supersonic bomber, codenamed "Backfire" by Nato, which has been used extensively in attacks on Ukrainian cities. Modern versions such as the Tu-22M3 can reach speeds of Mach 2 (2,300km/h or 1,430mp/h) and can carry up to 24,000kg of weapons, including "dumb bombs" and homing missiles. They have been used in conflicts in Syria, Chechnya, and Georgia and most recently in Ukraine. According to prosecutors in Kyiv, 30 people were killed when a Tu-22-launched missile hit a block of flats in Dnipro in January. They said Russia\'s 52nd Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment carried out the attack. The regiment is based at Soltsy-2. BBC Verify confirmed the location of the Ukrainian drone attack on Soltsy-2 by comparing visual clues - such as the appearance of aircraft and bays - to historical satellite images of the airbase. The weather conditions at the time - wet and overcast - also matched the weather in the images, as well as other witness photos of the incident. The remnants of the aircraft visible in the footage are consistent with that of a Tu-22M3. Historical satellite imagery analysed by BBC Verify shows that aircraft of this kind were stationed at the base. On Monday, a spokesperson for Ukraine\'s defence intelligence service said another military aircraft had been damaged in a drone attack in Russia\'s Kaluga region. Russian media also reported the attack, but denied there had been any damage.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The 100-year-old wood house on Front Street is still standing as most of the town of Lahaina has been destroyed. Its owners have been left wondering what spared it. From pictures, "it looks like it was photoshopped in", owner Trip Millikin told Honolulu Civil Beat. The search and recovery efforts are still ongoing in Maui, with 114 confirmed deaths so far. Officials say some 850 people are missing, but over 1,200 people who had been on the list have been found safe. The blazes destroyed most of the historic Maui town of Lahaina and the fires are now considered the worst natural disaster in Hawaii state history. President Joe Biden arrived in Hawaii on Monday to see the devastation. The red-roofed home\'s owners were on a trip to Massachusetts when they heard news of the fire. Mr Millikin and his wife learnt that the whole neighbourhood had been caught in the blaze and would likely burn down. But the next morning, aerial footage showed their house was intact. "We started crying," he told Honolulu Civil Beat. "I felt guilty. We still feel guilty." Mr Millikin and his wife said they are unsure exactly what saved their home. Two years ago, the couple purchased the 100-year-old property that used to be a bookkeeper\'s house for employees of a sugar plantation. Mr Millikin and his wife said the house was in disrepair, so they sought to restore it. It may have been these renovations that saved the home, the pair told US media. They switched out the home\'s asphalt roof for one with heavy-gauge metal, surrounded the house with river stones and removed foliage around it. But none of these actions were meant to stop a blaze, they said. "It\'s a 100% wood house, so it\'s not like we fireproofed it or anything," Dora Atwater Millikin told the Los Angeles Times. She said as the fires blazed, large pieces of wood would hit people\'s roofs. "If it was an asphalt roof, it would catch on fire. And otherwise, they would fall off the roof and then ignite the foliage around the house," she said. She added that the home\'s distance from its neighbours may have also served as a cushion. The couple say they hope to return to Lahaina when it\'s safe, and when they do, they plan to offer up their home for the many who have lost theirs. "Many people have died," said Ms Atwater Millikin. "So many people have lost everything, and we need to look out for each other and rebuild. Everybody needs to help rebuild."', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Results statement and text:  There are more women than men quoted in your story.
There were 5 women and 1 man quoted as additional sources in your story.
Women tend to be quoted more on topics such as lifestyle, entertainment, and healthcare, while men tend to feature more in articles about sports, politics, and business. Unless the story is specifically about women or men, or a group of people who happen to be of one gender, it is often desirable to try to get a good balance of voices to avoid reinforcing stereotypes about gender roles.
The female sources quoted in this text may play a personal or highly specific role in the story and therefore be hard to replace with other sources. Nonetheless, you might want to consider including more male perspectives.

Results statement and text:  We were not able to confidently determine the gender of any of the additional sources quoted.
Gender is complex and not limited to "male" or "female". Furthermore, naming conventions vary by culture and individual preference, so it is not always possible to accurately determine the gender of a person by their name alone.
Nonetheless, it is always good to try to get diverse perspectives in your story.

Dr Ravi Jayaram, who is a senior paediatrician at the Countess of Chester Hospital, had joined other doctors in warning NHS bosses about the serial killer months before police were called in. Now, after the 33-year-old was jailed for life without the possibility of parole today, Dr Jayaram has unleashed his fury on hospital managers who he says ordered him and colleagues to apologise to the nurse after raising their concerns about her conduct. Speaking to ITV News tonight, the paediatrician said he is angry at the failure of bosses to apologise given what has happened since police made the horrific findings in their investigation into the deaths, code named Operation Hummingbird. He added that he was \'incensed\' by attempts from hospital managers to try and justify their decisions after the full extent of Letby\'s depraved crimes were revealed. Last night the director of nursing at the hospital while Letby was on her murder spree was suspended. The TV doctor told ITV News that it was was \'absolutely correct\' that Letby, who was jailed for life without the possibility of parole on Monday after being convicted of seven murders and six attempted murders, will spend the rest of her days behind bars. He said: \'But it doesn\'t change the fact that parents of these babies and their families will never get back what\'s been taken away from them. And it\'s made me angry that she hasn\'t had the courage to be there to face up to them.\' But he added that he was also furious with NHS managers who he says have failed to take responsibility for their actions that didn\'t stop her sooner. He said: \'I think throughout this whole process there have been opportunities for those people who are at the top of the Countess of Chester to be able to put their hands up and admit that they got it wrong and apologise. \'They could have done this very early on, the very moment that Operation Hummingbird was launched. They could have done it at the point that Lucy Letby was first arrested. They could have done this at the point she was first charged. \'They could have done it as the trial progressed and more and more evidence came through. They certainly had a massive opportunity to do it on Friday when the verdicts were announced. \'And part of being a professional is being able to admit you got it wrong, it\'s about being able to admit, and have the balls to actually put your hands up and say "we made a terrible mistake, we can\'t undo it, but we apologise". \'But instead, and this is what\'s incensed me more than anything, they are still trying to find reasons why what they did was the right thing. \'For example, one of them said we weren\'t loud enough in expressing our concerns. How much louder could we be?\' A tearful Dr Jayaram added that he had been trying to do his job and \'look after babies and children\' by raising his concerns. Last week the senior paediatrician said he believed if bosses had taken action sooner \'four or five babies who could be going to school now who aren\'t\'. After raising their concerns about Letby, a group of doctors at the Countess of Chester Hospital were advised by bosses to apologise to her or face a possible referral to the General Medical Council. Count 1 - Murder of Baby A on June 8, 2015 - GUILTY Count 2 - Attempted murder of Baby B between the June 8, 2015 and June 11, 2015 - GUILTY Count 3 - Murder of Baby C on June 14, 2015 - GUILTY Count 4 - Murder of Baby D on June 22, 2015 - GUILTY Count 5 - Murder of Baby E on August 4, 2015 - GUILTY Count 6 - Attempted murder of Baby F on August 5, 2015 - GUILTY Count 7 - Attempted murder of Baby G on September 7, 2015 - GUILTY Count 8 - Attempted murder of Baby G on September 21, 2015 - GUILTY Count 9 - Attempted murder of Baby G on September 21, 2015 - NOT GUILTY Count 10 - Attempted murder of Baby H on September 26, 2015 - NOT GUILTY Count 12 - Murder of Baby I on October 23, 2015 - GUILTY Count 15 - Attempted murder of Baby L on April 9, 2016 - GUILTY Count 16 - Attempted murder of Baby M on April 9, 2016 - GUILTY Count 17 - Attempted murder of Baby N on June 3, 2016 - GUILTY Count 20 - Murder of Baby O on June 23, 2016 - GUILTY Count 21 - Murder of Baby P on June 24, 2016 - GUILTY In a letter, which has been seen by ITV News, consultants allegedly wrote under duress: \'Dear Lucy, we would like to apologise for any inappropriate comments that may have been made during this difficult period. We are very sorry for the stress and upset that you have experienced in the last year. Please be reassured that patient safety has been our absolute priority during this difficult time.\' Police would later be called into the hospital trust nearly two years after the deaths of the first of the seven babies Letby was convicted of murdering. The Government has since ordered an independent inquiry into the circumstances behind her murder spree, but Dr Jayaram has said it doesn\'t go far enough. He told ITV News tonight: \'There have been other inquiries into NHS scandals which have been statutory full public inquiries. \'Why on earth would this be announced as a non-statutory inquiry? Is the priority speed? \'I would much rather have an inquiry that asked the right questions and took as much time as it needed to get the right answers.\' Medical Director Ian', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

I hear that the Queen, 76, may be beset by the ache of nostalgia, as I can reveal that her first love, Kevin Burke, has died aged 77. The pair met during the Queen's halcyon days as a fun-loving debutante, where she was adored by a slew of male admirers from the high society soirees that she would frequent. Mr Burke died earlier this month, with the family asking for donations to be made to the British Heart Foundation. His funeral will take place in September. The young Milla Shand as she was known is thought to have met Kevin, the then 19-year-old son of Sir Aubrey Burke deputy chairman of the aircraft manufacturer, Hawker Siddeley, shortly after her coming out party in Knightsbridge in 1965. What followed was a whirlwind of glittering soirees against the backdrop of the swinging sixties where at sweet seventeen, Ms Milla Shand was the life and soul of the party. Although their affair was short-lived, Mr Burke spoke very fondly of his former flame, as he reminisced about their time together in Jessica Jayne's biography: The Duchess of Cornwall her story and secrets. 'Every night we had two or three cocktail parties to go to and a dance and a couple of dances to choose from at weekends in the country,' he revealed. 'It was the best fun, and I had the best and most fun partner you could possibly wish for. Camilla was immensely popular and although she wasn't a beauty, she was attractive and sexy.' Indeed, so popular was Milla, that it wasn't long before she moved on from Mr Burke and left him heartbroken. 'I remained with Camilla all that year. I suppose we were in love and then she ditched me. Why? Well, the short answer is that she was having a ball in London,' he revealed. She later married her first husband the former Army officer Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973 with whom she had two children, Tom and Laura. They divorced in 1995. Having become a chartered accountant, Kevin Burke finally settled down at the aged of 42. His first marriage to advertising executive Peta Baker lasted 14 years ending in 2001. Then he wed former head-hunter Luisa Fairey, with whom he became a father for the first time at 58. Speaking at the time he said, 'It was unexpected, but I am a lucky fellow.' Kevin is survived by his 'much loved' son Max.", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Spanish authorities had issued a European Arrest Warrant for the pair after up to eight men were accused of attacking an 18-year-old girl at a party hotel on the island of Majorca last week. The girl fled a hotel room after believing she had been attacked by up to eight men at around 5am last Monday, August 14, telling police she had woken up surrounded by young people holding mobile phones. Officers later identified three men by ringing the girl's phone, which it was claimed had been stolen during the ordeal, and luring them to a meeting. A total of six suspects had been taken into custody prior today. A number of men have since been taken into custody by police, with police in France making the latest arrests after Spanish cops discovered the men had flown to Germany before crossing the border en route to the French city of Strasbourg. The pair now face extradition to Majorca, while Civil Guard officers announced today their probe to identify the men involved had now concluded. A spokesman for the force said: 'The Civil Guard has closed the investigation sparked by the alleged gang rape that took place in a hotel in Magaluf in the early hours of August 14.' He added: 'Officers saw early on the complexity of the investigation, as the alleged aggressors didn't form part of the same group of friends but encouraged by other participants, had allegedly joined the group action in sporadic acts, meaning no type of relationship existed between them.' Confirming the first six suspects had been held the day of the alleged sex attack and remanded in prison, the force said in a statement: 'The probe continued to identify the two young men whose arrests were pending. 'One they had been identified, officers discovered they had taken a flight to Baden-Baden in Germany so they could head to their homes in the Strasbourg area. 'The Civil Guard sought the assistance of the French authorities through the normal channels and issued European Arrest Warrants to avoid them evading justice. 'On Sunday the French police confirmed they arrested one of them in the French locality of Scherwiller before subsequently confirming a second arrest at Basilea Mulhouse Freiburg Airport in France, when that suspect was trying to take a flight to Turkey to avoid detention.' Earlier this week it was reported the first of the Magaluf gang-rape suspects was held after Spanish police got him to answer the 'stolen' mobile phone of the British teenager allegedly targeted. Officers are said to have dialled the girl's phone number and one of the alleged French attackers answered her device. The man who answered and two of his friends were then duped into heading to the hotel's reception without realising that they were going to meet police and the girl. The alleged victim pointed at the men – named as Anthony G, 20, Anthony A, 20, and Khalil A, 18 – and they were quickly arrested. Two other French men Thomas E, 23, and Romain C, 26, were reportedly arrested later at the hotel along with the Swiss man Lucas H who is aged 20. The arrests were made after the victim described the men to police and 'various surveillance devices' were placed on the hotel entrances. All six men were held on suspicion of rape and remanded in custody on Tuesday at a court hearing on the island capital Palma. Over the weekend it emerged the judge who refused the six suspects bail and remanded them in prison pending an ongoing criminal probe had concluded the Brit teen had suffered 'really humiliating and degrading treatment' and described the men's claims sex was consensual as 'completely preposterous.' Mobile phone footage of the alleged sex attack, seized by police on the suspects' phones and handed over to the investigating judge, is said to have shown the men had been 'enjoying themselves and laughing.' On Sunday Ultima Hora published more details of the judge's remand ruling it appeared to have been given full or partial access to, saying the suspects had allegedly 'deliberately taken advantage' of their alleged victim's drunkenness to persuade her to accompany them to a hotel room before 'surrounding her' and 'carrying out numerous sexual practices' with her despite her 'obvious lack of awareness and willing to carry out those practices.' The criminal investigation has now been passed on to Palma's Court of Instruction Number Two, having been dealt with by a duty court in its initial stages. The British teenager, who gave a statement to police as well as the investigating judge in court, is said to have flown back to the UK with a female friend who was on holiday with her. Medical reports revealed that the girl had several bruises or grip marks on her right arm, suggesting she had been held down, and a small cut on her upper chest. Police have already confirmed they found footage on the suspects' mobile phones showing the alleged multiple rape that is now in the hands of the investigating judge and could form a 'key part' of the case. BH Mallorca Resort, the hotel where the alleged sex attack took place, has said it is cooperating fully with police and offered its support to the unnamed holidaymaker. A spokesman said in a statement released last Thursday: 'The BH Mallorca Resort deeply regrets what has happened and would like to manifest its firm and forceful repudiation of the alleged sexual attack that occurred in the early hours of Monday August 14 at the hotel. 'The hotel also wants to demonstrate its solidarity with the alleged victim of this aggression. 'We are co-operating fully with the Civil Guard and its investigators in everything they consider to be necessary. 'This hotel ratifies through this statement its commitment to the condemnation of all types of sexual attacks that affect peoples' dignity", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The suspected criminal, who is believed to have been plundering the museum for years, could have removed millions of pounds worth of items without being detected. The scale of the losses is said to have shocked staff at the museum after they were discovered following an internal probe into Peter Higgs, the curator of Mediterranean cultures who was sacked this summer. He denies any wrongdoing. The world-famous institution has refused to say how many items have gone missing, but the Telegraph reports that sources inside the museum believe the true number to be over 1,000 and 'closer to 2,000'. It was revealed yesterday that the British Museum hid the disappearance of the valuable items from the public for eight months after calling in the police in January this year. Police are investigating the losses, although no arrests have been made so far in relation to the thefts. The Rev Prof Martin Henig, a University of Oxford expert on Roman art, called the scandal 'totally unforgivable'. He told the Telegraph: 'This is the worst case that I've come across like this because it involves not just selling the odd object, but also destruction.' He added that although the items are small, 'they were particularly valued in antiquity and they tell us more than sculpture about life in the past. They were very intimate items'. One source told the publication the museum had been 'negligent and incompetent' in how it had dealt with the thefts and the subsequent discovery. A British Museum spokesman told the publication: 'This is all now subject to a police investigation as well as the independent review. We cannot comment further.' It was claimed over the weekend that chiefs at the museum showed a 'lack of reaction' after being warned treasures from its inventory were being sold online. Dr Ittai Gradel, an expert in Roman antiquities raised the alarm after spotting artefacts for sale that had appeared in a museum catalogue almost a century ago. The Danish academic claimed he alerted the British Museum in February 2021 and was 'not pleased with the reaction or lack of reaction I had from them'. He suggested that the culprit may have also taken 'unregistered items' from the museum collection, but 'became so sloppy that they put on eBay two items that had been published in the British Museum catalogue from 1926'. His remarks followed last month's sacking of Peter John Higgs, a curator who worked at the museum for over 30 years, after jewellery, gems and precious metals spanning more 3,000 years vanished from the archives. It subsequently emerged that a number of the items had previously appeared on eBay at rock bottom prices. They include an item of Roman jewellery made from onyx which was advertised on the site in 2016 with a price tag of £40. Experts believe the piece, which did not attract any bids, is actually worth between £25,000 and £50,000. Police are investigating, although Mr Higgs's family insist he is innocent and no arrests have been made.", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The pair, who have not been named in local media, face up to five years in jail after being charged with nuclear offences following their arrest in Ruden, Carinthia State, Austria, earlier this year. Detectives say they found materials for making bombs, including the explosive TNT, black powder and ball bearings, as well as detonators, at the property occupied by the men. Additionally, the authorities say they found a plethora of guns, including military assault rifles, at the house occupied by what is believed to be a cult of people preparing for the end of the world. The 67-year-old Brits, along with a 29-year-old Austrian co-conspirator, have been charged with conspiring to use 'a nuclear fuel, a radioactive substance, an explosive' to create bombs, local media reported. Police are understood to be looking for a fourth accomplice, reportedly a 68-year-old Austrian national, who remains at large. Police discovered components of male lethal pipe bombs, including 1.5 kilogrammes (3.3 lbs) of TNT, 8.5 kilogrammes (18.7 lbs) of black powder, ball bearings and steel tubing inside the home. It is understood that the deadly concoction, which included sulphuric acid, was enough to create nine powerful DIY bombs. Investigators also found 20 detonators and a mobile phone which prosecutors believe was to be used as a trigger. Additionally, police found powerful hunting rifles, military assault rifles, shotguns, handguns and boxes of ammunition at the property. The three accused are to stand trial at Klagenfurt District Court as of Tuesday, 22nd August. Public Prosecutor's spokesperson Tina Frimmel-Hesse said: 'Such cases are very rare. The quantity was sufficient to produce eight pipe bombs with a devastating effect.' Frimmel-Hesse added that the offenders refused to reveal what they had planned to do with the explosives when questioned. The three accused were arrested after one of them called for an ambulance during a medical emergency, according to local media. Responding paramedics immediately called police after seeing the arsenal at the property. Officers then arrested the three inhabitants and sealed the estate. A spokesman for the Klagenfurt State Prosecution told Newsflash: 'The men will be in court over the illegal possession of weapons and explosives.' The three men reportedly lived a very reclusive life and had no interest in talking to their neighbours. However, one local told the news outlet: 'The house they acquired some years ago is extremely dilapidated. The region is very quiet and rural, not a lot is going on there. 'Their neighbours don't know anything about the three men. It has to be seen whether they were part of some conspiracy network or just weird hermits.'", 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Results statement and text:  We were not able to confidently determine the gender of any of the additional sources quoted.
Gender is complex and not limited to "male" or "female". Furthermore, naming conventions vary by culture and individual preference, so it is not always possible to accurately determine the gender of a person by their name alone.
Nonetheless, it is always good to try to get diverse perspectives in your story.

Fiona Campbell
Title: Quality Assurance Associate
Company/location: Tower Cold Chain
About: Starting out in archaeology and moving on to degrees in Classics equipped me well for my initial career in the Museum world as well as giving me perspective and an ability to write well. An eye for detail was further developed during my time at RedBox Advertising agency where I first encountered web design in a commercial environment. Building websites (using HTML and CSS) in my spare time eventually enabled me to land a role at the Victoria & Albert Museum where I designed the personal website for my boss and was then seconded to the Web Team. My association with and enthusiasm for IT and roles in IT in any format remains undiminished.I have also gained extensive experience of finance and budget management, (which I have since put to good and enjoyable use in other roles), Health & Safety management and team management. H&S has since led to Quality, requiring a similar mental attitude. I have very good research skills and have done a great deal of training delivery.

The evil nurse, 33, is expected to be caged at maximum-security HMP Low Newton in County Durham, where prisoners have included fellow serial killer Rose West. Other inmates have included Tracey Connelly, the evil mum of Baby P who was abused and died in Tottenham, north London, and extremist Roshonara Choudhry, who stabbed MP Stephen Timms in 2010. Mairead Philpott who, along with her husband Mick, started a fire that killed six of her children and Karen Matthews, who faked the kidnapping of her daughter Shannon, have also spent time there. At the prison, inmates can pet sheep and goats and look after a rabbit and birds - all in a bid to keep them "calm", a report by the jail\'s Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) has revealed. The prison also boasts a shop where inmates can buy clothing. Inmates in parts of the prison can decorate their own rooms - while pink towelling and beauty products are also on offer. Twisted Letby was last week found guilty of murdering seven babies during a nearly 10-month trial. She was also convicted of attempting to kill six other newborns. She used insulin and air to inject newborns in a year-long killing spree while working on the neo-natal ward at the Countess of Chester Hospital in Cheshire. Letby was today given a whole life tariff for murder, which means she will never be released. She is expected to serve her sentence at HMP Low Newton. Images have revealed inside the prison, where despite its maximum-security conditions there are colourful drapes and paintings on walls. An alternative option is being sent to HMP Bronzefield in Ashford in Surrey, the largest female prison in Europe. Other female serial killers given whole life orders include West, Moors Murderer Myra Hindley and Joanna Dennehy West and Dennehy are among the inmates to have spent time at Low Newton, which was built in 1965. It became an all-female maximum-security prison 33 years later while also housing young offenders. Shameless Letby today refused to attend Manchester Crown Court as the judge handed down his sentence - prompting families\' anger. There were also tears in court as the brave relatives of Letby\'s victims read powerful victim impact statements. Experts have said Letby\'s possible motives included an "obsession" with a doctor at the hospital and enjoyment of a sick "thrill".', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Kandice Barber has been meeting her lover - convicted fraudster Jay Delaney - while on work release. Barber, a mum-of-three, 37, was sentenced to six years and two months in prison in 2021 after she groomed her student, 15, over text before sleeping with him. Currently on a temporary prison release, she is now working at a site building council homes, in Hounslow, West London. And it\'s since been revealed that she has been “planning a life together” with new girlfriend Delaney. The loved-up pair, both on temporary release, have been cuddling and holding hands during their walks to and from work before sneaking off for secret romps. A source told The Sun: “Kandice is only allowed out to go to work - but she and her new partner have been meeting up in secret. “They’ve been meeting up on her way to work and her way home. “It’s frustrating that she’s still in prison but they’re now meeting up for, you know, ‘time together’ shall we say. "They’ve been taking pictures together and talking about their future together.” The convicts are also planning to move in together once they leave prison. Pictures show the pair proudly posing and smiling together outside London Bridge station and Maidstone East station. One pic is even edited so they have white love hearts surrounding them. Despite asking permission several times, the couple are yet to have been allowed to go on a “day-out” together. Delaney was jailed for conning her pals and colleagues into giving her almost £400,000 of their life savings so she could fund her gambling habits. She balled her eyes out as the judge gave her four years and eight months after she pleaded guilty to 38 counts in April last year. Barber, who worked at a school in Princes Risborough, Bucks, first flirted with her schoolboy victim in messages sent during a school assembly. She also sent him topless snaps. The mum, from Wendover, Bucks, kissed the boy on the neck and \xadwhispered “What do you want to do now?” before driving him to a field where they had sex. The source continued: “Ultimately Kandice is a paedophile and she’s in prison for that. “So why is she allowed to be in love and have a lovely time while she’s meant to be paying time for it? “She groomed this boy. She should pay for it. It\'s just wrong. She’s supposed to be having a hard time. It makes me feel sick. “Why is she allowed to leave and shag her partner whenever she wants and have a normal life.” Kandice reportedly has shown no remorse for her crimes and still maintains her innocence. Her loyal ex Danny Barker, supported her through her trial - even after she was sentenced. Danny, 40, recently told how he decided to stop supporting Kandice when he had a realisation during one of his prison visits. He explained: “When I took the kids to visit Kan in prison, she\'d be smiling and bubbly and happy. Her hair was done. "I\'d sit there and feel: \'This is wrong. You\'re smiling and happy in a place we shouldn\'t be coming to visit you\'." The Ministry of Justice said prisoners are subject to “tough risk assessments” before they are allowed out on temporary release. It added: “They must also abide by strict rules and face extra time behind bars if they don’t comply.”', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Before Queen\'s Camilla happy love story began with King Charles, Kevin was the first man who captured her heart. Camilla is thought to have met Kevin at a party in Knightsbridge in 1965. Mr Burke sadly died earlier this month, with the family asking for donations to be made to the British Heart Foundation. His funeral will take place in September. The pair met during the Queen\'s halcyon days as a fun-loving debutante in high society during the swinging sixties. And although their affair was short-lived, Mr Burke spoke very fondly of his former flame. He had previously reminisced about their time together in Jessica Jayne\'s biography: The Duchess of Cornwall her story and secrets. Kevin revealed: \'"Every night we had two or three cocktail parties to go to and a dance and a couple of dances to choose from at weekends in the country." "It was the best fun, and I had the best and most fun partner you could possibly wish for. Camilla was immensely popular." Indeed, so popular was the now Queen, that it wasn\'t long before she moved on from Kevin and left him heartbroken. He said: "I remained with Camilla all that year. I suppose we were in love and then she ditched me. Why? "Well, the short answer is that she was having a ball in London." Camilla later married her first husband the former Army officer Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973 with whom she had two children, Tom and Laura. Having become a chartered accountant, Kevin finally settled down at the aged of 42. His first marriage to advertising executive Peta Baker lasted 14 years ending in 2001. Then he wed former head-hunter Luisa Fairey, with whom he became a father for the first time at 58. Kevin is survived by his "much loved" son Max.', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

A spokeswoman added: “As this car is not allowed to be driven on the road as its MOT has expired, it would not achieve the aim of the scheme to pay to scrap a car that cannot be driven. “Should the vehicle pass an MOT, we would be able to pay a grant payment of up to £2000 to remove the polluting vehicle from the roads.”', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

The pop singer announced that she was expecting in February during her Super Bowl Halftime Show performance. Rihanna, 35, and A$AP, 34, reportedly welcomed a baby boy on August 3 in Los Angeles, California, sources told TMZ. Insiders told the news outlet that the child\'s name "starts with the letter R." Last year, the couple welcomed a son named RZA on May 13. Months earlier, on January 31, 2022, Rihanna let the world know that she and Rocky were expecting when she was photographed flaunting her baby bump during an outing in New York City. Leading up to her Super Bowl 2023 Halftime show, Rihanna dropped a surprising number of hints that she was expecting but no one caught them until her rep confirmed her pregnancy following the show. Rihanna was said to have broken X, formerly known as Twitter, with her reveal, according to many netizens who experienced delays with the app after her performance. "Is Rihanna pregnant" was trending on the app and Google after the performer wore a red bomber-style jacket that seemed to both hide, and also accentuate, her baby bump. Regarding her first pregnancy, the GRAMMY Award winner told Vogue: "I wouldn’t say [we were] planning [to start a family] but certainly not planning against it. "I don’t know when I ovulate or any of that type of s**t. We just had fun and then it was just there on the test." She also explained motherhood\'s effect on her sense of fashion and shared: "My body is doing incredible things right now and I’m not going to be ashamed of that. "This time should feel celebratory, why should you be hiding your pregnancy?" While putting on a show-stopping Halftime performance at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, fans believed that the cameraman "ruined" Rihanna\'s pregnancy confirmation. The singer began her medley of hits by singing her track B***h Better Have My Money as she stood high above the field on a platform. The camera focused on a close-up of her face and only her shoulders could be seen. As it panned out, Rihanna pushed her bright red boiler suit slightly to the side as she rubbed her baby bump – but it was a blink-and-you-\'ll-miss-it moment as the camera zoomed out quickly. Some fans were left disappointed and immediately took to X. "Honestly though, the cameraman ruined Rihanna’s announcement," one person wrote. "Rihanna rubbed her belly to announce she was pregnant and the cameraman cut away," another fan said. And a third person tweeted: "Rihanna is pregnant. In the very beginning, she opened her jacket and rubbed her belly as the announcement. The cameraman just didn’t get that shot right." On December 2, 2019, whispers of Rihanna and A$AP Rocky\'s relationship began making the rounds. The two hitmakers attended the British Fashion Awards together and Rocky wore a FENTY tuxedo designed by her. The pair were later seen together on a number of occasions but did not speak on the romance rumors. On May 19, 2021, the latter confirmed that he was dating the FENTY Beauty mogul. The DMB rapper described Rihanna as "the love of his life" to GQ. "She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones. "I think when you know, you know. She’s the one."', 'recommendations': 'N/A', 'source_suggestions': 'N/A', 'sources_detected': 'N/A'}

Results statement and text:  We were not able to confidently determine the gender of any of the additional sources quoted.
Gender is complex and not limited to "male" or "female". Furthermore, naming conventions vary by culture and individual preference, so it is not always possible to accurately determine the gender of a person by their name alone.
Nonetheless, it is always good to try to get diverse perspectives in your story.
