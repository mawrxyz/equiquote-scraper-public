      "Britney Spears' estranged husband Sam Asghari has broken his silence following the news that he is filing for divorce from his estranged wife. In a statement to his Instagram account on Thursday, the actor, 29, wrote: 'After 6 years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together.' He continued: 'We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always,' adding: 'S**t happens.' 'Asking for privacy seems ridiculous so I will just ask for everyone including media to be kind and thoughtful.' The latest update comes amid reports the Toxic singer, 41, got physical with Asghari several times and once gave him a black eye as he slept. Asghari reportedly told friends that the pop princess would attack him during their seven years together, sources told TMZ, adding there were numerous fights where security had to step in between the pair. The model was reportedly left stunned after his then-wife started punching him as he was sleeping in their bed. He was pictured with bruising on his arms and face earlier this year, with sources saying the dates coincide with the\n",

One told TMZ that Britney was 'was paranoid someone was going to get her, and she needed the knives as protection.' The star is also accused of 'flying off the handle' at the smallest things, which left Asghari terrified. Insiders on Thursday told TMZ that Asghari had suspected that the Grammy-winning singer had cheated on him with a staffer at the Southern California home they shared; and that video footage shot on the property implicates Spears in being unfaithful. Asghari was suspicious that the Womanizer vocalist - described by sources as being in 'a fragile and hyper-sexualized state' - had also asked a staffer to film her while she was naked. Spears' alleged behavior was described by a source to the outlet as risky 'to her own safety;' and that her infidelity was what persuaded Asghari to move forward in his divorce filing. The latest details in the split come after DailyMail.com revealed that their relationship had descended into a dark and desperate state in the final weeks of their union. Sources\n",

'The reality of life with Britney was that it was not fun and it's not a surprise at all that the marriage didn't last,' the insider shared. Asghari cited 'irreconcilable differences' when he filed for divorce from the singer - as sources claim that he felt he couldn't leave Spears alone. According to court docs, Asghari is asking the multi-millionaire for spousal support and to cover his attorneys fees. DailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for Britney for comment. Asghari's lawyer Neal Hersh said that their finances need to be determined — despite the couple having an 'iron clad' prenup in place that protects the singer's premarital assets. The prenup stated that he was entitled to '$1 million per every two years' of their marriage, with a cap at $10 million after 15 years, according to US Weekly. He has also allegedly waived any claims to Britney's music collection, and his name is not listed on the deeds of their shared home.

In the since-deleted video, the hitmaker was dancing in the raunchy clip to Nine Inch Nails' X-rated song Closer, a classic of edgy dance and industrial music. She was spotted for the first time since the split, behind the wheel of her white Mercedes-Benz as she drove around in Los Angeles. Her ring-free hand was displayed as she steered the wheel of her luxury vehicle down a winding road near her Thousand Oaks home. Britney has yet to comment on the divorce news, but she did break her silence by sharing a bizarre Instagram post about vowing to buy a horse 'soon.' Since tying the knot in 2022, Britney has added to her fortune by signing a $15 million deal with publishing house Simon & Schuster for a tell-all memoir titled The Woman In Me. But it could be that the book may serve as a reminder for another failed relationship, with the happy ending of their marriage meant to serve as an important narrative.

      "of Tiny Dancer with Elton John, and Mind Your Business with will.i.am. Page Six reported that Britney has hired celebrity divorce attorney Laura Wasser — who boasts A-list clients such as Kim Kardashian, Kevin Costner and Johnny Depp. But it's been alleged that Asghari is threatening to release 'extraordinarily embarrassing' information about his spouse if she refuses to renegotiate the terms — something a source close to Spears told DailyMail.com is 'absurd.' She previously enlisted Wasser's help in 2008 as she fought her ex-husband Kevin Federline, 45, over custody of their two sons. The exes — who split in 2006 after two years of marriage — share Jayden James, 16, and Sean Preston, 17. A judge ordered Spears to pay $20,000 a month in child support — a decision that Wasser said the Piece Of Me hitmaker felt 'great' about. The monthly payments reportedly increased to $60,000 in 2018 and Kevin has full custody of the boys. He reportedly moved the family to Hawaii last month, without saying goodbye to Britney. Wasser is huge proponent for prenups regardless of wealth status as she believes marrying someone is the 'biggest decision of your life.' DailyMail.com confirmed Wednesday that Asghari and Spears\n",

      "A mother-of-three has been spared jail for a fourth time after attacking police - this time after assaulting two officers when she got drunk on board an airplane. Jessica Horne, 33, also racially abused a cabin crew member while flying on a Ryanair jet from Fuerteventura to Manchester in March 2022. Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court heard how Horne - who has three previous convictions for attacking police - had been drinking all day before boarding the 8pm flight and had also bought a bottle of Grey Goose vodka to drink on board. Lisa Boocock, prosecuting, said that mid way through the flight an 'intoxicated' Horne, who was travelling with her partner and their young son, was spotted vaping in her seat. A male member of crew 'told her to stop five times' and eventually took the vape from her. He then guided Horne, who'd got into an argument with her partner, to the rear of the aircraft to calm her down but it had 'little effect', Ms Boocock said. Her partner was so concerned about her behaviour he spoke to the crew member while a 'Good Samaritan' gave up their seat in a further attempt to calm the situation.\n",

      "Horne, of Briercliffe, Burnley, then started to touch the crew member and tried to kiss him on the cheek, the court heard. She also demanded he return her vape, grabbed him and stroked his name badge, leaving him 'feeling uncomfortable'. When the crew member - who is of Fillipino origin - refused, Horne racially abused him calling him a 'f****** c****' and a 'cheeky c****' several times. She also told him: 'Go back home'. The crew member was left so 'distressed', Ms Boocock said, he asked the captain to divert the plane but 'that wasn't practical' and he described the incident as the 'worst he'd ever had' with a passenger in four years of flying. Fortunately, Horne fell asleep 40 minutes before the flight was due to land and was arrested by police when the plane touched down. But she spat at one officer and punched and scratched another, leaving her with a black eye and cut to the top of her eyelid. She also swore at them, calling them: 'C****.' In a victim impact statement, the female officer said she expected to deal with intoxicated people but the attack had left her explaining her injuries to her family who\n",

      "were already 'fearful' about her role. It had affected her confidence, she said, and she couldn't understand why she had been assaulted when she was just trying to do her job. The court heard Horne has a number of previous convictions for similar offences. In February 2017, she was handed a 12-week curfew after racially abusing a taxi driver and a police officer, who she kicked in the shins. But the curfew was later lifted so she could could attend a weekend Centre Parcs holiday to celebrate her mum's 60th birthday. A few months later she attacked two police officers, kicking one in his privates and labelling his female colleague a 'lesbian c***', but was given a conditional discharge by magistrates. In 2018, she walked free from court again for carrying out a third attack on a police officer. For the latest incident, Horne pleaded guilty to charges of being drunk on an aircraft, two counts of assaulting an emergency worker and of racially aggravated harassment. The prosecution chose to offer no evidence on a fifth charge of sex assault, which will lie on file. Christian Kavanagh, defending, said Horne had made 'drastic changes in her character to address her\n",

      "behaviour' and was 'disgusted' by her actions. She acknowledged the impact it had on other passengers, he said, and she had a 'clear motivation' to address her issues. The court heard Horne's drinking had escalated during a previous abusive relationship, which resulted in her partner being jailed twice. The judge, Mr Recorder Imran Shafi KC, said Horne had a 'huge problem with alcohol' and labelled her behaviour 'disgraceful'. He said she had acted like she was on 'private flight and could behave how she felt' and not on a Ryanair holiday flight with other passengers 'who had to put up with your behaviour for four hours'. The judge described her attacks of the two police officers as 'thuggery' and said he had considered jailing her but was mindful she had three children aged 3, 9 and ten. Therefore, he decided to hand Horne an 18-month sentence, suspended for two years, and imposed 90-day rehabilitation order of alcohol abatement and monitoring. Horne was also ordered to pay the female police officer £1,000 in compensation.\n",
